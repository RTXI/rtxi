Configure with one of the following commands:
# For udev: "./configure --with-udev-hotplug=/lib --sysconfdir=/etc" 
# For old hotplug: "./configure --enable-etc-hotplug --sysconfdir=/etc"
This makes sure that the udev files are installed in /etc and not 
in /usr/local/etc.

'./configure --help' will give the configuration options.  

If the configure script does not exist (if you checked comedilib out
from cvs for example), it can be generated by running './autogen.sh'.
The autoconf, automake, autoheader, etc. tools are required to
generate the configure script (automake version >= 1.5 recommended).

The configure script will not enable the Python or Ruby bindings
unless 'swig' is installed and the Python or Ruby development
packages are installed.

Compile using 'make'.  If this doesn't work, make sure you have the
basic tools installed to compile. If you can successfully compile
other things, consult the author, as he has probably made a mistake.

Install using 'make install' as root.  This installs the files:
	/usr/lib/libcomedi.so.0.x
	/usr/include/comedi.h
	/usr/include/comedilib.h
	and other things...

To write programs that use comedi, look at examples in the demo/ and
the documentation in the doc/ directory.

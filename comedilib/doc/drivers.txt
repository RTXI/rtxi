Driver: 8255
Description: generic 8255 support

The classic in digital I/O.  The 8255 appears in Comedi as a single
digital I/O subdevice with 24 channels.  The channel 0 corresponds
to the 8255's port A, bit 0; channel 23 corresponds to port C, bit
7.  Direction configuration is done in blocks, with channels 0-7,
8-15, 16-19, and 20-23 making up the 4 blocks.  The only 8255 mode
supported is mode 0.

You should enable compilation this driver if you plan to use a board
that has an 8255 chip.  For multifunction boards, the main driver will
configure the 8255 subdevice automatically.

This driver also works independently with ISA and PCI cards that
directly map the 8255 registers to I/O ports, including cards with
multiple 8255 chips.  To configure the driver for such a card, the
option list should be a list of the I/O port bases for each of the
8255 chips.  For example,

  comedi_config /dev/comedi0 8255 0x200,0x204,0x208,0x20c

Note that most PCI 8255 boards do NOT work with this driver, and
need a separate driver as a wrapper.  For those that do work, the
I/O port base address can be found in the output of 'lspci -v'.

  PCI-9118HR (pci9118hr)
Status: works

This driver supports AI, AO, DI and DO subdevices.
AI subdevice supports cmd and insn interface,
other subdevices support only insn interface.
For AI:
- If cmd->scan_begin_src=TRIG_EXT then trigger input is TGIN (pin 46).
- If cmd->convert_src=TRIG_EXT then trigger input is EXTTRG (pin 44).
- If cmd->start_src/stop_src=TRIG_EXT then trigger input is TGIN (pin 46).
- It is not neccessary to have cmd.scan_end_arg=cmd.chanlist_len but
  cmd.scan_end_arg modulo cmd.chanlist_len must by 0.
- If return value of cmdtest is 5 then you've bad channel list
  (it isn't possible mixture S.E. and DIFF inputs or bipolar and unipolar
  ranges).

There are some hardware limitations:
a) You cann't use mixture of unipolar/bipoar ranges or differencial/single
   ended inputs.
b) DMA transfers must have the length aligned to two samples (32 bit),
   so there is some problems if cmd->chanlist_len is odd. This driver tries
   bypass this with adding one sample to the end of the every scan and discard
   it on output but this cann't be used if cmd->scan_begin_src=TRIG_FOLLOW
   and is used flag TRIG_WAKE_EOS, then driver switch to interrupt driven mode
   with interrupt after every sample.
c) If isn't used DMA then you can use only mode where
   cmd->scan_begin_src=TRIG_FOLLOW.

Configuration options:
  [0] - PCI bus of device (optional)
  [1] - PCI slot of device (optional)
          If bus/slot is not specified, then first available PCI
          card will be used.

This driver supports AI, AO, DI and DO subdevices.
AI subdevice supports cmd and insn interface,
other subdevices support only insn interface.

The PCI-1710 and PCI-1710HG have the same PCI device ID, so the
driver cannot distinguish between them, as would be normal for a
PCI driver.

  [0] - PCI bus of device (optional)
  [1] - PCI slot of device (optional)
          If bus/slot is not specified, the first available PCI

Each PPI is a 8255 chip providing 24 DIO channels.  The DIO channels
are configurable as inputs or outputs in four groups:

  Port A  - channels  0 to  7
  Port B  - channels  8 to 15
  Port CL - channels 16 to 19
  Port CH - channels 20 to 23

Only mode 0 of the 8255 chips is supported.

Each CTR is a 8254 chip providing 3 16-bit counter channels.  Each
channel is configured individually with INSN_CONFIG instructions.  The
specific type of configuration instruction is specified in data[0].
Some configuration instructions expect an additional parameter in
data[1]; others return a value in data[1].  The following configuration
instructions are supported:

  INSN_CONFIG_SET_COUNTER_MODE.  Sets the counter channel's mode and
    BCD/binary setting specified in data[1].

  INSN_CONFIG_8254_READ_STATUS.  Reads the status register value for the
    counter channel into data[1].

  INSN_CONFIG_SET_CLOCK_SRC.  Sets the counter channel's clock source as
    specified in data[1] (this is a hardware-specific value).  Not
    supported on PC214E.  For the other boards, valid clock sources are
    0 to 7 as follows:

      0.  CLK n, the counter channel's dedicated CLK input from the SK1
        connector.  (N.B. for other values, the counter channel's CLKn
        pin on the SK1 connector is an output!)
      1.  Internal 10 MHz clock.
      2.  Internal 1 MHz clock.
      3.  Internal 100 kHz clock.
      4.  Internal 10 kHz clock.
      5.  Internal 1 kHz clock.
      6.  OUT n-1, the output of counter channel n-1 (see note 1 below).
      7.  Ext Clock, the counter chip's dedicated Ext Clock input from
        the SK1 connector.  This pin is shared by all three counter
        channels on the chip.

  INSN_CONFIG_GET_CLOCK_SRC.  Returns the counter channel's current
    clock source in data[1].  For internal clock sources, data[2] is set
    to the period in ns.

  INSN_CONFIG_SET_GATE_SRC.  Sets the counter channel's gate source as
    specified in data[2] (this is a hardware-specific value).  Not
    supported on PC214E.  For the other boards, valid gate sources are 0
    to 7 as follows:

      0.  VCC (internal +5V d.c.), i.e. gate permanently enabled.
      1.  GND (internal 0V d.c.), i.e. gate permanently disabled.
      2.  GAT n, the counter channel's dedicated GAT input from the SK1
        connector.  (N.B. for other values, the counter channel's GATn
        pin on the SK1 connector is an output!)
      3.  /OUT n-2, the inverted output of counter channel n-2 (see note
        2 below).
      4.  Reserved.
      5.  Reserved.
      6.  Reserved.
      7.  Reserved.

  INSN_CONFIG_GET_GATE_SRC.  Returns the counter channel's current gate
    source in data[2].

Clock and gate interconnection notes:

  1.  Clock source OUT n-1 is the output of the preceding channel on the
  same counter subdevice if n > 0, or the output of channel 2 on the
  preceding counter subdevice (see note 3) if n = 0.

  2.  Gate source /OUT n-2 is the inverted output of channel 0 on the
  same counter subdevice if n = 2, or the inverted output of channel n+1
  on the preceding counter subdevice (see note 3) if n < 2.

  3.  The counter subdevices are connected in a ring, so the highest
  counter subdevice precedes the lowest.

The 'INTERRUPT' subdevice pretends to be a digital input subdevice.  The
digital inputs come from the interrupt status register.  The number of
channels matches the number of interrupt sources.  The PC214E does not
have an interrupt status register; see notes on 'INTERRUPT SOURCES'
below.

When an interrupt source is enabled in the interrupt source enable
register, a rising edge on the source signal latches the corresponding
bit to 1 in the interrupt status register.

When the interrupt status register value as a whole (actually, just the
6 least significant bits) goes from zero to non-zero, the board will
generate an interrupt.  For level-triggered hardware interrupts (PCI
card), the interrupt will remain asserted until the interrupt status
register is cleared to zero.  For edge-triggered hardware interrupts
(ISA card), no further interrupts will occur until the interrupt status
register is cleared to zero.  To clear a bit to zero in the interrupt
status register, the corresponding interrupt source must be disabled
in the interrupt source enable register (there is no separate interrupt
clear register).

The PC214E does not have an interrupt source enable register or an
interrupt status register; its 'INTERRUPT' subdevice has a single
channel and its interrupt source is selected by the position of jumper
J5.

COMMANDS

The driver supports a read streaming acquisition command on the
'INTERRUPT' subdevice.  The channel list selects the interrupt sources
to be enabled.  All channels will be sampled together (convert_src ==
TRIG_NOW).  The scan begins a short time after the hardware interrupt
occurs, subject to interrupt latencies (scan_begin_src == TRIG_EXT,
scan_begin_arg == 0).  The value read from the interrupt status register
is packed into a sampl_t value, one bit per requested channel, in the
order they appear in the channel list.

The PC36AT ISA board and PCI236 PCI board have a single 8255 appearing
as subdevice 0.

Subdevice 1 pretends to be a digital input device, but it always returns
0 when read. However, if you run a command with scan_begin_src=TRIG_EXT,
a rising edge on port C bit 7 acts as an external trigger, which can be
used to wake up tasks.  This is like the comedi_parport device, but the
only way to physically disable the interrupt on the PC36AT is to remove
the IRQ jumper.  If no interrupt is connected, then subdevice 1 is
unused.

Supports:

  - ao_insn read/write
  - ao_do_cmd mode with the following sources:

    - start_src         TRIG_INT        TRIG_EXT
    - scan_begin_src    TRIG_TIMER      TRIG_EXT
    - convert_src       TRIG_NOW
    - scan_end_src      TRIG_COUNT
    - stop_src          TRIG_COUNT      TRIG_EXT        TRIG_NONE

    The channel list must contain at least one channel with no repeated
    channels.  The scan end count must equal the number of channels in
    the channel list.

    There is only one external trigger source so only one of start_src,
    scan_begin_src or stop_src may use TRIG_EXT.

Configuration options - PCI224:
  [0] - PCI bus of device (optional).
  [1] - PCI slot of device (optional).
          If bus/slot is not specified, the first available PCI device
          will be used.
  [2] - Select available ranges according to jumper LK1.  All channels
        are set to the same range:
        0=Jumper position 1-2 (factory default), 4 software-selectable
          internal voltage references, giving 4 bipolar and 4 unipolar
          ranges:
            [-10V,+10V], [-5V,+5V], [-2.5V,+2.5V], [-1.25V,+1.25V],
            [0,+10V], [0,+5V], [0,+2.5V], [0,1.25V].
        1=Jumper position 2-3, 1 external voltage reference, giving
          1 bipolar and 1 unipolar range:
            [-Vext,+Vext], [0,+Vext].

Configuration options - PCI234:
  [0] - PCI bus of device (optional).
  [1] - PCI slot of device (optional).
          If bus/slot is not specified, the first available PCI device
          will be used.
  [2] - Select internal or external voltage reference according to
        jumper LK1.  This affects all channels:
        0=Jumper position 1-2 (factory default), Vref=5V internal.
        1=Jumper position 2-3, Vref=Vext external.
  [3] - Select channel 0 range according to jumper LK2:
        0=Jumper position 2-3 (factory default), range [-2*Vref,+2*Vref]
          (10V bipolar when options[2]=0).
        1=Jumper position 1-2, range [-Vref,+Vref]
          (5V bipolar when options[2]=0).
  [4] - Select channel 1 range according to jumper LK3: cf. options[3].
  [5] - Select channel 2 range according to jumper LK4: cf. options[3].
  [6] - Select channel 3 range according to jumper LK5: cf. options[3].

Passing a zero for an option is the same as leaving it unspecified.

Caveats:

  1) All channels on the PCI224 share the same range.  Any change to the
     range as a result of insn_write or a streaming command will affect
     the output voltages of all channels, including those not specified
     by the instruction or command.

  2) For the analog output command,  the first scan may be triggered
     falsely at the start of acquisition.  This occurs when the DAC scan
     trigger source is switched from 'none' to 'timer' (scan_begin_src =
     TRIG_TIMER) or 'external' (scan_begin_src == TRIG_EXT) at the start
     of acquisition and the trigger source is at logic level 1 at the
     time of the switch.  This is very likely for TRIG_TIMER.  For
     TRIG_EXT, it depends on the state of the external line and whether
     the CR_INVERT flag has been set.  The remaining scans are triggered
     correctly.

Devices: [Amplicon] PCI230 (pci230 or amplc_pci230), PCI230+ (pci230+),
  PCI260 (pci260 or amplc_pci230), PCI260+ (pci260+)
Status: works

Configuration options:
  [0] - PCI bus of device (optional).
  [1] - PCI slot of device (optional).
          If bus/slot is not specified, the first available PCI device
          will be used.

Configuring a "amplc_pci230" will match any supported card and it will
be treated as "pci230" or "pci260".  Configuring a "pci230" will match a
PCI230 or PCI230+ card and it will be treated as a PCI230.  Configuring
a "pci260" will match a PCI260 or PCI260+ card and it will be treated as
a PCI260.  Configuring a "pci230+" will match a PCI230+ card.
Configuring a "pci260+" will match a PCI260+ card.

Subdevices:

                PCI230(+)    PCI260(+)

  Subdevices       3            1
        0          AI           AI 
	1          AO
	2          DIO

AI Subdevice:

  The AI subdevice has 16 single-ended channels or 8 differential
  channels.
  
  The PCI230 and PCI260 cards have 12-bit resolution.  The PCI230+ and
  PCI260+ cards have 16-bit resolution.
  
  For differential mode, use inputs 2N and 2N+1 for channel N (e.g. use
  inputs 14 and 15 for channel 7).  If the card is physically a PCI230
  or PCI260 then it actually uses a "pseudo-differential" mode where the
  inputs are sampled a few microseconds apart.  The PCI230+ and PCI260+
  use true differential sampling.  Another difference is that if the
  card is physically a PCI230 or PCI260, the inverting input is 2N,
  whereas for a PCI230+ or PCI260+ the inverting input is 2N+1.  So if a
  PCI230 is physically replaced by a PCI230+ (or a PCI260 with a
  PCI260+) and differential mode is used, the differential inputs need
  to be physically swapped on the connector.

  The following input ranges are supported:

    0 => [-10, +10] V
    1 => [-5, +5] V
    2 => [-2.5, +2.5] V
    3 => [-1.25, +1.25] V
    4 => [0, 10] V
    5 => [0, 5] V
    6 => [0, 2.5] V

AI Commands:

  +=========+==============+===========+============+==========+
  |start_src|scan_begin_src|convert_src|scan_end_src| stop_src |
  +=========+==============+===========+============+==========+
  |TRIG_NOW | TRIG_FOLLOW  |TRIG_TIMER | TRIG_COUNT |TRIG_NONE |
  |TRIG_INT |              |TRIG_EXT(3)|            |TRIG_COUNT|
  |         |              |TRIG_INT   |            |          |
  |         |--------------|-----------|            |          |
  |         | TRIG_TIMER(1)|TRIG_TIMER |            |          |
  |         | TRIG_EXT(2)  |           |            |          |
  |         | TRIG_INT     |           |            |          |
  +---------+--------------+-----------+------------+----------+

  Note 1: If AI command and AO command are used simultaneously, only
          one may have scan_begin_src == TRIG_TIMER.

  Note 2: For PCI230 and PCI230+, scan_begin_src == TRIG_EXT uses
          DIO channel 16 (pin 49) which will need to be configured as
          a digital input.  For PCI260+, the EXTTRIG/EXTCONVCLK input
          (pin 17) is used instead.  For PCI230, scan_begin_src ==
          TRIG_EXT is not supported.  The trigger is a rising edge
          on the input.

  Note 3: For convert_src == TRIG_EXT, the EXTTRIG/EXTCONVCLK input
          (pin 25 on PCI230(+), pin 17 on PCI260(+)) is used.  The
          convert_arg value is interpreted as follows:

            convert_arg == (CR_EDGE | 0) => rising edge
            convert_arg == (CR_EDGE | CR_INVERT | 0) => falling edge
            convert_arg == 0 => falling edge (backwards compatibility)
            convert_arg == 1 => rising edge (backwards compatibility)

  All entries in the channel list must use the same analogue reference.
  If the analogue reference is not AREF_DIFF (not differential) each
  pair of channel numbers (0 and 1, 2 and 3, etc.) must use the same
  input range.  The input ranges used in the sequence must be all
  bipolar (ranges 0 to 3) or all unipolar (ranges 4 to 6).  The channel
  sequence must consist of 1 or more identical subsequences.  Within the
  subsequence, channels must be in ascending order with no repeated
  channels.  For example, the following sequences are valid: 0 1 2 3
  (single valid subsequence), 0 2 3 5 0 2 3 5 (repeated valid
  subsequence), 1 1 1 1 (repeated valid subsequence).  The following
  sequences are invalid: 0 3 2 1 (invalid subsequence), 0 2 3 5 0 2 3
  (incompletely repeated subsequence).  Some versions of the PCI230+ and
  PCI260+ have a bug that requires a subsequence longer than one entry
  long to include channel 0.

AO Subdevice:

  The AO subdevice has 2 channels with 12-bit resolution.

  The following output ranges are supported:

    0 => [0, 10] V
    1 => [-10, +10] V

AO Commands:

  +=========+==============+===========+============+==========+
  |start_src|scan_begin_src|convert_src|scan_end_src| stop_src |
  +=========+==============+===========+============+==========+
  |TRIG_INT | TRIG_TIMER(1)| TRIG_NOW  | TRIG_COUNT |TRIG_NONE |
  |         | TRIG_EXT(2)  |           |            |TRIG_COUNT|
  |         | TRIG_INT     |           |            |          |
  +---------+--------------+-----------+------------+----------+

  Note 1: If AI command and AO command are used simultaneously, only
          one may have scan_begin_src == TRIG_TIMER.

  Note 2: scan_begin_src == TRIG_EXT is only supported if the card is
          configured as a PCI230+ and is only supported on later
          versions of the card.  As a card configured as a PCI230+ is
          not guaranteed to support external triggering, please consider
          this support to be a bonus.  It uses the EXTTRIG/ EXTCONVCLK
          input (PCI230+ pin 25).  Triggering will be on the rising edge
          unless the CR_INVERT flag is set in scan_begin_arg.

  The channels in the channel sequence must be in ascending order with
  no repeats.  All entries in the channel sequence must use the same
  output range.

DIO Subdevice:

  The DIO subdevice is a 8255 chip providing 24 DIO channels.  The DIO
  channels are configurable as inputs or outputs in four groups:

    Port A  - channels  0 to  7
    Port B  - channels  8 to 15
    Port CL - channels 16 to 19
    Port CH - channels 20 to 23

  Only mode 0 of the 8255 chip is supported.

  Bit 0 of port C (DIO channel 16) is also used as an external scan
  trigger input for AI commands on PCI230 and PCI230+, so would need to
  be configured as an input to use it for that purpose.

Updated: Thu, 20 Jun 2002 16:19:41 -0500
Status: works

All features of the PCIM-DDA06-16 board are supported.  This board
has 6 16-bit AO channels, and the usual 8255 DIO setup.  (24 channels,
configurable in banks of 8 and 4, etc.).  This board does not support commands.

The board has a peculiar way of specifying AO gain/range settings -- You have
1 jumper bank on the card, which either makes all 6 AO channels either
5 Volt unipolar, 5V bipolar, 10 Volt unipolar or 10V bipolar.

Since there is absolutely _no_ way to tell in software how this jumper is set
(well, at least according  to the rather thin spec. from Measurement Computing
 that comes with the board), the driver assumes the jumper is at its factory
default setting of +/-5V.

Also of note is the fact that this board features another jumper, whose
state is also completely invisible to software.  It toggles two possible AO
output modes on the board:

  - Update Mode: Writing to an AO channel instantaneously updates the actual
    signal output by the DAC on the board (this is the factory default).
  - Simultaneous XFER Mode: Writing to an AO channel has no effect until
    you read from any one of the AO channels.  This is useful for loading
    all 6 AO values, and then reading from any one of the AO channels on the
    device to instantly update all 6 AO values in unison.  Useful for some
    control apps, I would assume?  If your jumper is in this setting, then you
    need to issue your comedi_data_write()s to load all the values you want,
    then issue one comedi_data_read() on any channel on the AO subdevice
    to initiate the simultaneous XFER.

Configuration Options:
  [0] PCI bus (optional) (unimplemented)
  [1] PCI slot (optional) (unimplemented)
  [2] analog output range jumper setting
      0 == +/- 5 V

Updated: Mon, 10 Oct 00:18:25 -0500
Status: works

This driver allows you to 'bond' (merge) multiple comedi subdevices
(coming from possibly difference boards and/or drivers) together.  For
example, if you had a board with 2 different DIO subdevices, and
another with 1 DIO subdevice, you could 'bond' them with this driver
so that they look like one big fat DIO subdevice.  This makes writing
applications slightly easier as you don't have to worry about managing
different subdevices in the application -- you just worry about
indexing one linear array of channel id's.

Right now only DIO subdevices are supported as that's the personal itch
I am scratching with this driver.  If you want to add support for AI and AO
subdevs, go right on ahead and do so!

Commands aren't supported -- although it would be cool if they were.

Configuration Options:
  List of comedi-minors to bond.  All subdevices of the same type
  within each minor will be concatenated together in the order given here.

Notes:

Subdevices 0 is digital I/O, subdevice 1 is digital input, and
subdevice 2 is digital output.  Unlike other Comedi devices,
subdevice 0 defaults to output.

Pins 13 and 14 are inverted once by Comedi and once by the
hardware, thus cancelling the effect.

Pin 1 is a strobe, thus acts like one.  There's no way in software
to change this, at least on a standard parallel port.

Subdevice 3 pretends to be a digital input subdevice, but it always
returns 0 when read.  However, if you run a command with
scan_begin_src=TRIG_EXT, it uses pin 10 as a external triggering
pin, which can be used to wake up tasks.



Driver: comedi_rt_timer
Description: Command emulator using real-time tasks
Author: ds, fmhess
Devices:
Status: works

This driver requires RTAI or RTLinux to work correctly.  It doesn't
actually drive hardware directly, but calls other drivers and uses
a real-time task to emulate commands for drivers and devices that
are incapable of native commands.  Thus, you can get accurately
timed I/O on any device.

Since the timing is all done in software, sampling jitter is much
higher than with a device that has an on-board timer, and maximum
sample rate is much lower.

Configuration options:
  [0] - minor number of device you wish to emulate commands for
  [1] - subdevice number you wish to emulate commands for

Much of the functionality of this driver was determined from reading
the source code for the Windows driver.

The FPGA on the board requires initialization code, which can 
be loaded by comedi_config using the -i
option.  The initialization code is available from http://www.comedi.org
in the comedi_nonfree_firmware tarball.

Configuration options:

Updated: 2003-10-12

A rewrite of the das16 and das1600 drivers.
Options:
	[0] - base io address
	[1] - irq (does nothing, irq is not used anymore)
	[2] - dma (optional, required for comedi_command support)
	[3] - master clock speed in MHz (optional, 1 or 10, ignored if
		board can probe clock, defaults to 1)
	[4] - analog input range lowest voltage in microvolts (optional,
		only useful if your board does not have software
		programmable gain)
	[5] - analog input range highest voltage in microvolts (optional,
		only useful if board does not have software programmable
		gain)
	[6] - analog output range lowest voltage in microvolts (optional)
	[7] - analog output range highest voltage in microvolts (optional)
	[8] - use timer mode for DMA.  Timer mode is needed e.g. for
		buggy DMA controllers in NS CS5530A (Geode Companion), and for
		'jr' cards that lack a hardware fifo.  This option is no
		longer needed, since timer mode is _always_ used.

Passing a zero for an option is the same as leaving it unspecified.




Driver: das16m1
Description: CIO-DAS16/M1
Author: Frank Mori Hess <fmhess@users.sourceforge.net>
Devices: [Measurement Computing] CIO-DAS16/M1 (cio-das16/m1)
Status: works

This driver supports a single board - the CIO-DAS16/M1.
As far as I know, there are no other boards that have
the same register layout.  Even the CIO-DAS16/M1/16 is
significantly different.

I was _barely_ able to reach the full 1 MHz capability
of this board, using a hard real-time interrupt
(set the TRIG_RT flag in your comedi_cmd and use
rtlinux or RTAI).  The board can't do dma, so the bottleneck is
pulling the data across the ISA bus.  I timed the interrupt
handler, and it took my computer ~470 microseconds to pull 512
samples from the board.  So at 1 Mhz sampling rate,
expect your CPU to be spending almost all of its
time in the interrupt handler.

This board has some unusual restrictions for its channel/gain list.  If the
list has 2 or more channels in it, then two conditions must be satisfied:
(1) - even/odd channels must appear at even/odd indices in the list
(2) - the list must have an even number of entries.

Options:
        [0] - base io address
        [1] - irq (optional, but you probably want it)

irq can be omitted, although the cmd interface will not work without it.

Notes:
	IRQ can be omitted, although the cmd interface will not work without it.

	All entries in the channel/gain list must use the same gain and be
	consecutive channels counting upwards in channel number (these are
	hardware limitations.)

	I've never tested the gain setting stuff since I only have a
	DAS-800 board with fixed gain.

	The cio-das802/16 does not have a fifo-empty status bit!  Therefore
	only fifo-half-full transfers are possible with this card.

This card has 16 analog inputs multiplexed onto a 12 bit ADC.  There

a power of 10, from 1 to 10^7, of which only 3 or 4 are useful.  In
addition, the clock does not seem to be very accurate.

The driver has 2.6 kernel isapnp support, and
will automatically probe for a supported board if the
I/O base is left unspecified with comedi_config.
However, many of
the isapnp id numbers are unknown.  If your board is not
recognized, please send the output of 'cat /proc/isapnp'
(you may need to modprobe the isa-pnp module for
/proc/isapnp to exist) so the
id numbers for your board can be added to the driver.

Otherwise, you can use the isapnptools package to configure
your board.  Use isapnp to
configure the I/O base and IRQ for the board, and then pass
the same values as
parameters in comedi_config.  A sample isapnp.conf file is included
in the etc/ directory of Comedilib.

Comedilib includes a utility to autocalibrate these boards.  The
boards seem to boot into a state where the all calibration DACs
are at one extreme of their range, thus the default calibration
is terrible.  Calibration at boot is strongly encouraged.

To use the extended digital I/O on some of the boards, enable the
8255 driver when configuring the Comedi source tree.

External triggering is supported for some events.  The channel index
(scan_begin_arg, etc.) maps to PFI0 - PFI9.

Some of the more esoteric triggering possibilities of these boards
are not supported.

16 channels.  The channel 0 corresponds to the daqcard-700's output
port, bit 0; channel 8 corresponds to the input port, bit 0.

emu as port A output, port B input, port C N/A).

Status: works

Tested with lab-pc-1200.  For the older Lab-PC+, not all input ranges
and analog references will work, the available ranges/arefs will
depend on how you have configured the jumpers on your board
(see your owner's manual).

Kernel-level ISA plug-and-play support for the lab-pc-1200
boards has not
yet been added to the driver, mainly due to the fact that
I don't know the device id numbers.  If you have one
of these boards,
please file a bug report at https://bugs.comedi.org/
so I can get the necessary information from you.

The 1200 series boards have onboard calibration dacs for correcting
analog input/output offsets and gains.  The proper settings for these
caldacs are stored on the board's eeprom.  To read the caldac values
from the eeprom and store them into a file that can be then be used by
comedilib, use the comedi_calibrate program.

Configuration options - ISA boards:
  [0] - I/O port base address
  [1] - IRQ (optional, required for timed or externally triggered conversions)
  [2] - DMA channel (optional)

Configuration options - PCI boards:
  [0] - bus (optional)
  [1] - slot (optional)

The Lab-pc+ has quirky chanlist requirements
when scanning multiple channels.  Multiple channel scan
sequence must start at highest channel, then decrement down to
channel 0.  The rest of the cards can scan down like lab-pc+ or scan
up from channel zero.  Chanlists consisting of all one channel
are also legal, and allow you to pace conversions in bursts.

The DIO-96 appears as four 8255 subdevices.  See the 8255
driver notes for details.

The DIO32HS board appears as one subdevice, with 32 channels.
Each channel is individually I/O configurable.  The channel order
is 0=A0, 1=A1, 2=A2, ... 8=B0, 16=C0, 24=D0.  The driver only
supports simple digital I/O; no handshaking is supported.

DMA mostly works for the PCI-DIO32HS, but only in timed input mode.

This driver could be easily modified to support AT-MIO32HS and
AT-MIO96.

The PCI-6534 requires a firmware upload after power-up to work, the
firmware data and instructions for loading it with comedi_config
it are contained in the
comedi_nonfree_firmware tarball available from http://www.comedi.org

These boards are almost identical to the AT-MIO E series, except that
they use the PCI bus instead of ISA (i.e., AT).  See the notes for
the ni_atmio.o driver for additional information about these boards.

Autocalibration is supported on many of the devices, using the
comedi_calibrate (or comedi_soft_calibrate for m-series) utility.
M-Series boards do analog input and analog output calibration entirely
in software. The software calibration corrects
the analog input for offset, gain and
nonlinearity.  The analog outputs are corrected for offset and gain.
See the comedilib documentation on comedi_get_softcal_converter() for
more information.

By default, the driver uses DMA to transfer analog input data to
memory.  When DMA is enabled, not all triggering features are
supported.

Digital I/O may not work on 673x.

Note that the PCI-6143 is a simultaineous sampling device with 8 convertors.
With this board all of the convertors perform one simultaineous sample during
a scan interval. The period for a scan is used for the convert time in a
Comedi cmd. The convert trigger source is normally set to TRIG_NOW by default.

The RTSI trigger bus is supported on these cards on
subdevice 10. See the comedilib documentation for details.

Information (number of channels, bits, etc.) for some devices may be
incorrect.  Please check this and submit a bug if there are problems
for your device.

SCXI is probably broken for m-series boards.

Bugs:
 - When DMA is enabled, COMEDI_EV_CONVERT does
   not work correctly.

Status: works

All cards have 16 SE/8 DIFF ADCs, one or two DACs, 16 DI and 16 DO.
Differences are only at maximal sample speed, range list and FIFO
support.
The driver support AI mode 0, 1, 3 other subdevices (AO, DI, DO) support
only mode 0. If DMA/FIFO/INT are disabled then AI support only mode 0.
PCL-818HD and PCL-818HG support 1kword FIFO. Driver support this FIFO
but this code is untested.
A word or two about DMA. Driver support DMA operations at two ways:
1) DMA uses two buffers and after one is filled then is generated
   INT and DMA restart with second buffer. With this mode I'm unable run
   more that 80Ksamples/secs without data dropouts on K6/233.
2) DMA uses one buffer and run in autoinit mode and the data are
   from DMA buffer moved on the fly with 2kHz interrupts from RTC.
   This mode is used if the interrupt 8 is available for allocation.
   If not, then first DMA mode is used. With this I can run at
   full speed one card (100ksamples/secs) or two cards with
   60ksamples/secs each (more is problem on account of ISA limitations).
   To use this mode you must have compiled  kernel with disabled
   "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support".
   Maybe you can have problems if you use xntpd or similar.
   If you've data dropouts with DMA mode 2 then:
    a) disable IDE DMA
    b) switch text mode console to fb.

Author: Calin Culianu <calin@ajvar.org>
Updated: Fri, 13 Jan 2006 12:01:01 -0500
Status: works

A driver for the relatively straightforward-to-program PCM-D/A-12.
This board doesn't support commands, and the only way to set its
analog output range is to jumper the board.  As such,
comedi_data_write() ignores the range value specified.

The board uses 16 consecutive I/O addresses starting at the I/O port
base address.  Each address corresponds to the LSB then MSB of a
particular channel from 0-7.

Note that the board is not ISA-PNP capable and thus
needs the I/O port comedi_config parameter.

Note that passing a nonzero value as the second config option will
enable "simultaneous xfer" mode for this board, in which AO writes
will not take effect until a subsequent read of any AO channel.  This
is so that one can speed up programming by preloading all AO registers
with values before simultaneously setting them to take effect with one
read command.

Configuration Options:
  [0] - I/O port base address
  [1] - Do Simultaneous Xfer (see description)

Author: Calin Culianu <calin@ajvar.org>
Updated: Wed, May 16 2007 16:21:10 -0500
Status: works

A driver for the relatively new PCM-MIO multifunction board from
Winsystems.  This board is a PC-104 based I/O board.  It contains
four subdevices:
  subdevice 0 - 16 channels of 16-bit AI
  subdevice 1 - 8 channels of 16-bit AO
  subdevice 2 - first 24 channels of the 48 channel of DIO (with edge-triggered interrupt support)
  subdevice 3 - last 24 channels of the 48 channel DIO (no interrupt support for this bank of channels)

  Some notes:

  Synchronous reads and writes are the only things implemented for AI and AO,
  even though the hardware itself can do streaming acquisition, etc.  Anyone
  want to add asynchronous I/O for AI/AO as a feature?  Be my guest...

  Asynchronous I/O for the DIO subdevices *is* implemented, however!  They are
  basically edge-triggered interrupts for any configuration of the first
  24 DIO-lines.

  Also note that this interrupt support is untested.

  A few words about edge-detection IRQ support (commands on DIO):

  * To use edge-detection IRQ support for the DIO subdevice, pass the IRQ
    of the board to the comedi_config command.  The board IRQ is not jumpered
    but rather configured through software, so any IRQ from 1-15 is OK.

  * Due to the genericity of the comedi API, you need to create a special
    comedi_command in order to use edge-triggered interrupts for DIO.

  * Use comedi_commands with TRIG_NOW.  Your callback will be called each
    time an edge is detected on the specified DIO line(s), and the data
    values will be two sample_t's, which should be concatenated to form
    one 32-bit unsigned int.  This value is the mask of channels that had
    edges detected from your channel list.  Note that the bits positions
    in the mask correspond to positions in your chanlist when you
    specified the command and *not* channel id's!

 *  To set the polarity of the edge-detection interrupts pass a nonzero value
    for either CR_RANGE or CR_AREF for edge-up polarity, or a zero
    value for both CR_RANGE and CR_AREF if you want edge-down polarity.

Configuration Options:
  [0] - I/O port base address
  [1] - IRQ (optional -- for edge-detect interrupt support only, leave out if you don't need this feature)



Driver: pcmuio
Description: A driver for the PCM-UIO48A and PCM-UIO96A boards from Winsystems.

Author: Calin Culianu <calin@ajvar.org>
Updated: Fri, 13 Jan 2006 12:01:01 -0500
Status: works

A driver for the relatively straightforward-to-program PCM-UIO48A and
PCM-UIO96A boards from Winsystems.  These boards use either one or two
(in the 96-DIO version) WS16C48 ASIC HighDensity I/O Chips (HDIO).
This chip is interesting in that each I/O line is individually
programmable for INPUT or OUTPUT (thus comedi_dio_config can be done
on a per-channel basis).  Also, each chip supports edge-triggered
interrupts for the first 24 I/O lines.  Of course, since the
96-channel version of the board has two ASICs, it can detect polarity
changes on up to 48 I/O lines.  Since this is essentially an (non-PnP)
ISA board, I/O Address and IRQ selection are done through jumpers on
the board.  You need to pass that information to this driver as the
first and second comedi_config option, respectively.  Note that the
48-channel version uses 16 bytes of IO memory and the 96-channel
version uses 32-bytes (in case you are worried about conflicts).  The
48-channel board is split into two 24-channel comedi subdevices.
The 96-channel board is split into 4 24-channel DIO subdevices.

Note that IRQ support has been added, but it is untested.

To use edge-detection IRQ support, pass the IRQs of both ASICS
(for the 96 channel version) or just 1 ASIC (for 48-channel version).
Then, use use comedi_commands with TRIG_NOW.
Your callback will be called each time an edge is triggered, and the data
values will be two sample_t's, which should be concatenated to form one
32-bit unsigned int.  This value is the mask of channels that had
edges detected from your channel list.  Note that the bits positions
in the mask correspond to positions in your chanlist when you specified
the command and *not* channel id's!

To set the polarity of the edge-detection interrupts pass a nonzero value for
either CR_RANGE or CR_AREF for edge-up polarity, or a zero value for both
CR_RANGE and CR_AREF if you want edge-down polarity.

In the 48-channel version:

On subdev 0, the first 24 channels channels are edge-detect channels.

In the 96-channel board you have the collowing channels that can do edge detection:

subdev 0, channels 0-24  (first 24 channels of 1st ASIC)
subdev 2, channels 0-24  (first 24 channels of 2nd ASIC)

Configuration Options:
  [0] - I/O port base address
  [1] - IRQ (for first ASIC, or first 24 channels)
  [2] - IRQ for second ASIC (pcmuio96 only - IRQ for chans 48-72 .. can be the same as first irq!)

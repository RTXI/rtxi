2008-01-28 15:51  fmhess

	* configure.ac: bumped version for 0.7.76 release.

2008-01-28 15:04  fmhess

	* Makefile.am: Allow generation of devices.txt and drivers.txt to
	  work when builddir != srcdir.

2008-01-28 15:03  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Suppress some compiler warnings

2008-01-28 14:32  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Replaced an "if(0)" with an "#if
	  0".

2008-01-28 08:54  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/ni_pcidio.c: Fix bug in
	  ni_pcidio_release_di_mite_channel() that prevented subsequent
	  commands working (it never set devpriv->di_mite_chan to NULL
	  after calling mite_release_channel()).

2008-01-16 12:03  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/ni_65xx.c: Corrected number of channels for DO
	  subdevice.

2008-01-14 13:05  abbotti

	* comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c: In comedi_do_insn: For
	  INSN_WAIT, make sure insn->n is exactly 1.  For subdevice
	  instructions, if subdevice is unused, return -EIO.  For subdevice
	  instructions, if chanspec is wrong, return -EINVAL.

2008-01-14 12:59  abbotti

	* comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c: In comedi_do_insn, #if'ed
	  out the final check for return value of subdevice insn function
	  matching insn.n.  Comedi documentation for userspace
	  comedi_do_insn allows a lower value to be returned and some
	  drivers blatently do so, particularly for configuration
	  instructions.

	  Also added some XXX reminder comments for INSN_WAIT and
	  INSN_CONFIG for things that need to be fixed.

2008-01-14 07:26  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Corrected test for INSN_WRITE data value
	  exceeding maxdata. It failed on subdevices that used per-channel
	  maxdata values (maxdata_list).

2008-01-14 07:13  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Applied comedi_indent script.

2008-01-13 18:07  bporr

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/drivers/usbdux.c,
	  include/linux/comedi.h: Added a proper PWM subdevice for comedi.
	  PWM is started with INSN_CONFIG_ARM where the second argument
	  defines the time how long PWM will last. A zero indicates
	  "forever".  PWM is stopped with INSN_CONFIG_DISARM. No further
	  args.  The duty cycle is set via a comedi_data_write where
	  maxdata defines the 100% duty cycle.	The PWM period is set by
	  INSN_CONFIG_PWM_SET_PERIOD where the second argument is in
	  nanoseconds, thus 1E9/frequency INSN_CONFIG_PWM_GET_PERIOD
	  retrieves the frequency which might have been corrected by the
	  driver INSN_GET_PWM_STATUS queries if it's on or off
	  INSN_CONFIG_PWM_SET_H_BRIDGE allows the transmit the duty cycle
	  with a polarity bit in the second argument.  See the usbdux
	  driver and its PWM section.

2008-01-07 06:05  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Only set SRF_RT subdevice flag if
	  comedi_switch_to_rt(dev) succeeds.

2008-01-02 12:41  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: For COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl, if argument is
	  NULL, refuse to unconfigure the device if any subdevices are busy
	  or have mmap'ed buffers.  The errno is EBUSY in this case.

2008-01-02 12:04  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Changed read, write, poll, and mmap file
	  operations to use the per-device mutex.  The mutex is released
	  during read and write operations that block.

2008-01-01 21:17  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/cb_pcidas64.c: Added board entry for 6013.

2007-12-20 10:12  abbotti

	* m4/as-linux.m4: Once the linux build directory has been
	  determined ($LINUX_DIR), try and override the previous setting of
	  the LINUX_KERNEL_RELEASE variable using the release info from the
	  Linux build directory.  Information comes from the UTS_RELEASE C
	  macro.  For kernel versions 2.6.18 and later this is defined in
	  include/linux/utsrelease.h.  For earlier kernel versions it is
	  defined in include/linux/version.h.

2007-12-17 11:43  abbotti

	* configure.ac, m4/as-linux.m4: Some changes for separate Linux
	  source and build trees.  Add LINUX_SRC_DIR variable to point to
	  Linux source tree (LINUX_DIR points to the Linux build tree).  It
	  can be set with a new --with-linuxsrcdir option or determined
	  automatically from the build tree.  Changed some configure tests
	  to check the Linux source tree instead of the build tree.  The
	  affected tests are COMEDI_CHECK_PCMCIA_PROBE,
	  COMEDI_CHECK_LINUX_KBUILD and COMEDI_CHECK_HAVE_MUTEX_H.  The
	  COMEDI_CHECK_LINUX_KBUILD test has been simplified because it no
	  longer has to check for separate source and build trees.

2007-12-12 09:55  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/drivers.c,
	  include/linux/comedidev.h: Use unlocked_ioctl file operation
	  instead of ioctl if kernel supports it and use a mutex in struct
	  comedi_device.  Some parts of the driver still need to be changed
	  to use the mutex.

2007-12-12 09:51  abbotti

	* configure.ac, m4/as-linux.m4: Check for include/linux/mutex.h in
	  kernel source.

2007-12-12 09:47  abbotti

	* include/linux/: Makefile.am, mutex.h: Added compatibility header
	  for <linux/mutex.h>.

2007-12-12 08:47  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/Makefile.am: For non-Kbuild make, don't build
	  addi-data drivers that use floating point, but include source in
	  EXTRA_DIST.  (Kbuild make already skips these drivers.)

2007-12-12 07:42  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/addi-data/addi_common.h: Corrected type qualifiers
	  for pc_DriverName in boardtype.

2007-12-12 07:28  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/addi-data/hwdrv_APCI1710.h: Removed #defines for
	  types (now they're all in addi_common.h).

2007-12-12 07:27  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/addi-data/addi_common.h: Use typedef instead of
	  #define to define MS-Windows types.  Add a few more pointer
	  types.

2007-12-12 06:34  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_compat32.c: Include <linux/ioctl32.h> if using
	  old-style register_ioctl32_conversion.

2007-12-11 22:12  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_pcimio.c: Converted initialization of board
	  array to modern standard (indent does a slightly less bad job of
	  indenting it this way).

2007-12-05 12:02  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: For read and write, check if command still
	  running in non-blocking mode as well.

2007-12-05 09:45  abbotti

	* comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c: Check for various errors
	  such as subdevice in range and support for commands.	Use
	  comedi_set_subdevice_runflags and comedi_get_subdevice_runflags
	  when checking/modifying SRF_RT runflag.

2007-12-05 09:41  abbotti

	* include/linux/comedi_rt.h: If comedi_switch_to_rt() is a macro it
	  should stil have a return value.

2007-12-05 07:52  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/comedi_ksyms.c,
	  comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c, include/linux/comedidev.h:
	  Use per-subdevice spin-lock instead of big_comedi_lock.  Renamed
	  existing subdevice 'runflags_lock' to 'spin_lock' for more
	  general use.	(Could have used a separate spin-lock for
	  locking/unlocking subdevices, but there shouldn't be much
	  contention for the existing spin-lock used for setting/ getting
	  runflags.)

2007-12-04 10:30  abbotti

	* include/asm/io.h: Define mmiowb() macro if necessary.

2007-12-04 08:11  abbotti

	* include/linux/slab.h: No need to define kcalloc() compatibility
	  function for kernel 2.6.9 onwards.  The kzalloc() compatibility
	  function is still required for vanilla kernels prior to 2.6.14,
	  but some versions of RHEL4 2.6.9 kernel (e.g. 2.6.9-42) already
	  declare it, so use a macro to override it with our own version.

2007-12-03 12:47  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Expanded documentation for the
	  driver.

2007-12-03 09:47  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: Report error event when command
	  stopped due to buffer overflow.

2007-12-03 09:43  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: Avoid setting s->async->inttrig to
	  NULL in interrupt routine.

2007-12-03 09:36  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: Avoid setting s->async->inttrig to
	  NULL in interrupt routine.

2007-12-03 08:57  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AO command, if scan_begin_src
	  is TRIG_INT and not using DAC FIFO, need to call comedi_event()
	  in the inttrig function because it isn't being called anywhere
	  else.

2007-12-03 08:31  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Avoid changing s->async->inttrig
	  during an interrupt.	In particular, do not set it to NULL when
	  stopping command during interrupt.

2007-11-30 13:37  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Use DAC FIFO if the card has one
	  (PCI230+ hardware version 2).

2007-11-30 07:21  abbotti

	* include/linux/comedi.h: Added enums for Amplicon DIO card clock
	  and gate sources.

2007-11-29 10:49  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: For AO command test step 3, return
	  3 if external trigger flags have been corrected.

2007-11-28 09:48  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: When stopping AO command, only
	  stop timer if using it (scan_begin_src==TRIG_TIMER).

2007-11-28 06:12  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Release Z2-CT2 resource after AI
	  command started if convert_src is neither TRIG_TIMER nor
	  TRIG_INT.

2007-11-27 11:43  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Avoid using software conversion
	  trigger as it doesn't work very well for differential mode on
	  some versions of PCI230/260.	Use Z2 timer 2 output instead and
	  toggle the output in software to trigger a conversion.  Note that
	  the ADC busy bit only works for software triggers in non-FIFO
	  mode, so for AI INSN_READ, use the FIFO and the FIFO status bits
	  to check when the conversion is complete.

2007-11-27 08:17  abbotti

	* include/linux/comedi_rt.h: RTAI support was broken in
	  comedi-0.7.75 due to missing RTAI_VERSION_CODE and
	  RTAI_MANGLE_VERSION in comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c.  Added
	  #include <rtai_version.h> to include/linux/comedi_rt.h to fix it.

2007-11-27 07:52  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Insert delay after AI internal
	  conversion trigger (convert_src==TRIG_INT) so we don't trigger
	  more often than the hardware is capable of.

2007-11-26 12:56  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Use programmable ADC FIFO
	  interrupt trigger level and ADC FIFO level registers on
	  PCI230+/260+ to reduce number of interrupts required when FIFO
	  interrupt trigger level would otherwise be "trigger when not
	  empty".

2007-11-25 16:22  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: Added PWM to the USBDUX. Also moved any
	  synchronous commands to EP1 which should reduce the latency
	  dramatically because it is single buffered which forces the host
	  to wait (no race checks needed anymore). The EP4 is now used for
	  the PWM.  The bit patterns are generated in this driver and the
	  GPIF on the FX2 streams these automatically out through the
	  digital port.

2007-11-23 12:09  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AI command, allow
	  scan_begin_src == EXT_TRIG for PCI260+ (but not PCI260).  It will
	  use the EXTTRIG/EXTCONVCLK input on pin 17 instead of the PPIC0
	  input that is used for PCI230.

2007-11-23 11:47  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AO command, support
	  scan_begin_src == TRIG_INT.  (Not terribly useful.) Also, if
	  scan_begin_src == TRIG_TIMER, make sure the timer gate is set
	  high to enable counting.

2007-11-23 11:08  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AI commands, support TRIG_INT
	  for start_src, scan_begin_src and convert_src, but not all at the
	  same time.

2007-11-23 10:05  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Increased maximum length of
	  channel list for AI command to 256 to allow a repeated
	  subsequence of channels to be used with a reasonable number of
	  repeats.  Can't make the maximum length too long or the
	  generation of N pulses using a monostable as a gate would
	  generate too many pulses in some circumstances.

2007-11-23 09:55  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Support scan_begin_src ==
	  TRIG_TIMER for AI command, but not at same time as AO command as
	  it uses one of the same 8254 counters.  Also, gone back to using
	  timer mode 3 (square wave) instead of mode 2 (pulse) as it seems
	  to induce less noise.

2007-11-23 06:04  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Changed some macros.  No
	  functional changes.

2007-11-22 13:20  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Overhauled setting up and handling
	  of commands, internal timers, and interrupts.

2007-11-21 13:14  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/adv_pci_dio.c: Fixed offset for isolated digital
	  input register on 1762.

2007-11-19 17:42  fmhess

	* AUTHORS: Added Jeremy Theler

2007-11-19 07:26  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Changed types of some members of
	  struct pci230_private and renamed 'ai_stop' to 'ai_continuous'
	  and 'ao_stop' to 'ao_continuous'.  No functional changes.

2007-11-16 09:34  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Reduced maximum speed (increased
	  minimum period) for AO conversion to 125 kHz (8000 ns).

2007-11-16 09:07  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For ai_cmdtest, maximum AI convert
	  rate depends on whether single-ended or differential, and whether
	  the card is a PCI230/260 or PCI230+/260+.

2007-11-16 08:17  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Need to use 'do_div' macro for
	  64-bit division.

2007-11-15 13:02  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For ai_cmdtest, check channel list
	  starts with channel 0 if there is more than one channel and the
	  card is an older PCI230+ or PCI260+ with buggy channel
	  sequencing.

2007-11-15 11:11  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Fix AI channel enables for
	  AREF_DIFF if the hardware is PCI230+ or PCI260+ due to a
	  difference in the way the register works between PCI230 and
	  PCI230+ in differential mode.

2007-11-13 07:01  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AI command, when convert_src
	  == TRIG_EXT, make interpretation of convert_arg backwards
	  compatible with previous versions if no flag bits are set.

2007-11-12 17:15  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Fixed sign error that prevented
	  commands from aborting properly on errors.

2007-11-12 12:10  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_compat32.c: Only added a comment.

2007-11-12 11:45  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AI command, changed
	  interpretation of scan_begin_arg when scan_begin_src is TRIG_EXT.
	  Previously, 0 meant trigger on -ve edge, 1 meant +ve edge.  Now,
	  the CR_INVERT flag is set to trigger on the -ve edge.

2007-11-12 10:04  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: The ADC half full flag flag and
	  interrupt occurs at 2049 samples, not 2048 (i.e. it's an "over
	  half full" flag since the FIFO size is 4096).

2007-11-12 09:58  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Use arrays to look up ai gain bits
	  and polarity.

2007-11-12 09:16  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/adq12b.c: Stripped ".o" from driver name on
	  "Driver:" line for consistency.

2007-11-12 07:16  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For AI INSN_READ, check for
	  out-of-range differential channel - only the first half of the
	  channel numbers can be used if analog ref is AREF_DIFF.

2007-11-10 11:59  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: Kbuild, Makefile.am, adq12b.c: Added new driver
	  from jeremy theler <thelerg@ib.cnea.gov.ar> for MicroAxial
	  ADQ12-B.

2007-11-10 11:53  fmhess

	* AUTHORS: Adding trivial email address obfuscation, since some of
	  the AUTHORS files are linked to from the web page.

2007-11-09 11:36  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: In pci230_choose_clk_src(), widen
	  the type of the comparison constant 6553600000 from ul to ull.

2007-11-09 11:02  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Check channel lists in AI and AO
	  cmdtest handlers if chanlist != NULL and chanlist_len > 0.

2007-11-09 10:39  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: Minor line-length fixes.

2007-11-09 10:23  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: In cmdtest, use DPRINTK instead of
	  comedi_error.

2007-11-09 10:19  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: For cmdtest, don't return 5 if
	  chanlist_len == 0.

2007-11-09 09:06  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: For cmdtest, don't return error 5
	  if chanlist is NULL.

2007-11-09 08:50  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: For COMEDI_CMD ioctl, check chanlist_len >
	  0.

2007-11-09 07:17  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_compat32.c: I forgot to rename comedi_compat_ioctl_
	  function back to comedi_compat_ioctl in the previous commit.

2007-11-09 06:12  abbotti

	* comedi/: comedi_compat32.c, comedi_compat32.h: Make the
	  'comedi_compat_ioctl' symbole a function (again) instead of a
	  macro (if HAVE_COMPAT_IOCTL is defined).

2007-11-08 12:09  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Got rid of the timer subdevice as
	  it was pretty useless and clashed with the AO and AI subdevices.
	  I may resurrect it as a counter subdevice at some point.

2007-11-08 12:02  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Use 64-bit ns value when
	  determining clock source.

2007-11-08 11:45  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Renamed pci_iobase to iobase1.

2007-11-08 11:33  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Used specific constants for base
	  addresses of 8254 and 8255 chips instead of using the constants
	  for the first channel of each.

2007-11-08 11:21  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Eliminated clock source and
	  divisor values from private data and combined a few functions.
	  Note: reading the period of the timer subdevice is now even more
	  broken than it was before, but I'm planning to remove it anyway
	  due to conflicts with the AI and AO subdevices.

2007-11-08 10:35  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Renamed some macros.  Now access
	  the timebase values via a look-up table to eliminate some switch
	  statements.

2007-11-08 06:51  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: amplc_pci230.c whitespace changes
	  / comment reformatting.

2007-11-08 05:52  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Spelling correction in
	  Description: line.

2007-11-07 12:18  abbotti

	* comedi/: comedi_compat32.c, comedi_compat32.h: Fix for 2.6.10 and
	  earlier.  Rename comedi_compat_ioctl function to
	  comedi_compat_ioctl_ and define comedi_compat_ioctl macro to
	  access it.  The comedi_compat_ioctl macro expands to 0 for 2.6.10
	  and earlier (HAVE_COMPAT_IOCTL undefined) so it tried to define a
	  function called '0'!

2007-11-07 11:24  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_compat32.c: Removed a stray comment.

2007-11-07 11:18  abbotti

	* comedi/comedi_compat32.c: Make sure 32-bit ioctl handler for <=
	  2.6.10 kernel doesn't return -ENOIOCTLCMD.

2007-11-07 11:03  abbotti

	* comedi/: Kbuild, Makefile.am, comedi_compat32.c,
	  comedi_compat32.h, comedi_fops.c: Support 32-bit ioctl calls on
	  64-bit kernel (CONFIG_COMPAT).

2007-11-05 09:07  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: Replaced INSN_CONFIG_8254_SET_MODE
	  with INSN_CONFIG_SET_COUNTER_MODE.

2007-11-05 06:50  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/: me4000.c, ni_mio_common.c: Inline fixes: define
	  inline functions before calling them.  Some versions of gcc treat
	  it as an error.  Others will ignore the inline in this case and
	  compile in a function call.

2007-11-05 06:47  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_fc.h: Made cfc_bytes_per_scan() 'static
	  inline' instead of plain 'inline'.

2007-11-02 07:11  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers.c: Security fix in comedi_buf_alloc() for non-DMA
	  data buffers.  Allocate each page using get_zeroed_page() instead
	  of __get_free_page() to avoid exposing random memory contents to
	  user space if the buffer is mmap'ed.

2007-11-01 13:47  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/addi-data/: addi_amcc_s5933.h, addi_common.c:
	  Sanitize resource types.  Use new comedi_pci_enable and
	  comedi_pci_disable functions instead of ad hoc calls to
	  request_region and release_region.

2007-11-01 12:14  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Check result of
	  subdev_8255_init().

2007-10-31 10:15  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: For PCI260(+) make subdevice 2
	  UNUSED instead of AO with no channels.

2007-10-31 10:01  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Added pci230+ and pci260+.
	  Currently they are treated same as pci230 and pci260 apart from
	  the increased number of bits on the AI subdevice.  The cards can
	  also be configured as the old pci230 or pci260.

2007-10-30 12:49  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: Untested compatibility fix for
	  change to rt_task_init in RTAI >= 3.3 (the context of the

2007-10-30 11:46  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/addi-data/addi_common.c: #ifdef out floating point
	  register stuff.

2007-10-29 11:52  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/cb_pcidio.c: Added PCI-DIO24 info supplied by

	  its own wait_queue_head_t.

2007-10-24 14:14  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Prevent glitches when
	  transitioning from static control of dio lines to waveform
	  output.

2007-10-24 08:37  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers.c: Allocate non-DMA buffer pages using
	  __get_free_page().  (Use of virt_to_page on vmalloc'd memory was
	  incorrect and failed on x86_64 for example.) Clean up fully on
	  allocation failure.

2007-10-22 10:59  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: Check dev->attached in interrupt
	  routine.

	* comedi/drivers/cb_das16_cs.c: Patch from Torben Mikael Hansen
	  <comedi_ns@linhard.dk> which adds device id for PCM-DAS16s/16.

2007-10-18 17:40  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h, ni_660x.c: Got rid of fragile
	  checks of specific device ids in mite.c (fixed problems with
	  pxi-6602 support).  Added device id for pxi-6608.  Made sure the
	  "window base size register" is disabled when using the "window
	  base size register 1", since it causes problems if both are
	  enabled simultaneously.

	  i8254_set_mode(), i8254_mm_set_mode(), i8254_status(),
	  i8254_mm_status().  The offsets to the four 8253/8254 registers
	  will be shifted left by this amount.	This is to cater for cards
	  where the four registers do not occupy consecutive bytes.

2007-09-30 10:42  fmhess

	* comedi/Makefile.am: Support DESTDIR for module install/uninstall.

2007-09-28 20:01  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: Fixed use of ai
	  channels >= 64 on 6225.  Based on patch from Ingmar Schoegl
	  <ischoegl@mail.utexas.edu>.

2007-09-28 14:40  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Eliminated the possibility of the
	  ao dma channel getting allocated more than once, when
	  ni_ao_inttrig gets called a second time after returning an error.

2007-09-14 08:33  abbotti

	* include/linux/Makefile.am: Add slab.h compatibility header.

	  drivers that have num_names > 1.

2007-09-05 23:22  fmhess

	* comedi/Makefile.am: Change $(GREP) to $(EGREP), since we really
	  only do a AC_PROG_EGREP in configure, and apparently GREP isn't
	  always defined, as reported by Anders Blomdell.

2007-09-05 08:37  fmhess

	  addi-data/hwdrv_apci3501.h, addi-data/hwdrv_apci3xxx.c: Patch
	  from Anders Blomdell <anders.blomdell@control.lth.se> which makes
	  some of the addi-data drivers useable:

	  Since I need to use a driver for apci3106, I guess that I'll have
	  to do some cleanup of the addi-data drivers, but after
	  downloading the drivers from addi-data
	  (http://www.addi-data.com/treiber/linux/comedi/comedi_Driver.tar.gz,
	  v_1.13), and comparing them with cvs, I'm at a loss about which
	  drivers to use as a starting point. I have enclosed a [tentative]
	  patch against CVS (patch.addi-data.20070828), that seems to work
	  with apci3106-16-4. There is also the patch against the CVS from
	  late 2005 (patch.addi.2005-11-11) that I sent to
	  weber.serge@addi-data.com, asking him to do additional cleanup
	  and then submit it to the CVS maintainers, obviously this never
	  happened :-( (and hence the last batch of cards was of another
	  brand).

2007-08-24 14:44  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: comedi_fc.c, comedi_fc.h, mite.c: Fixed some
	  calculations of number of bytes per scan when doing digital io
	  commands.

2007-08-21 05:47  abbotti

	* comedi/: comedi_fops.c, drivers.c: Sanity check drivers setting
	  do_cmd without setting do_cmdtest.

2007-08-17 16:54  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c: read acknowledges irq bit does have an
	  effect on a 6601.

2007-08-17 15:56  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_660x.c: Added interrupt handler and enabled
	  interrupts. Added initialization of output routing for pfi pins
	  to reasonable defaults.

2007-08-17 15:53  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c: Fixed missing initialization of some
	  counter registers (and their software copies).  Made
	  ni_tio_cancel() safe to call in interrupt context without
	  possibly corrupting software copies of registers.

2007-08-17 15:49  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedi.h: Added enum for setting output routing of
	  pfi pins on 660x boards.

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h, ni_tio.c,
	  ni_tio.h: Moved some interrupt enable/disable and interrupt
	  handling stuff from client drivers into ni_tio.c.  ni_stc.h:
	  Added some stuff for correlated digital output waveforms
	  that I missed in earlier commit.  ni_660x.c:	  Added beginnings
	  of support for buffered input counting (untested,	 definitely
	  doesn't work yet due to empty interrupt handler).    Added
	  INSN_CONFIG_SET/GET_ROUTING support,	    to allow switching of
	  output signals between    counter outputs and static digital
	  output.  Fixed channel mix-ups       on input/output selection
	  for static dio.  Fixed static digital 	output to work on
	  full 32 bits.  Replaced some preprocessor macros	with inline
	  functions.

2007-08-15 17:20  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedidev.h: Added comment describing purpose of

	  stop_src TRIG_COUNT.

2007-08-09 08:58  fmhess

	  status by reading status register.

2007-08-08 20:22  fmhess

2007-08-07 16:06  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Set SRF_RUNNING and SRF_ERROR together
	  atomically in comedi_event().

2007-08-07 12:22  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_tio.c, ni_tio.h:
	  Set missing SDF_LSAMPL on NI GPCT subdevices.  Made command test
	  for gpct command actually check something.  Made some of the
	  command sources for gpct command actually have an effect.

2007-08-06 07:19  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/: comedi_fc.c, mite.c, ni_atmio16d.c, pcmad.c:

	  specific packages.

2007-07-27 14:52  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/mpc8260cpm.c: Change driver name from "dummy" to
	  "mpc8260cpm".

2007-07-27 10:54  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/: cb_pcidda.c, ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c,
	  ni_tio.c, unioxx5.c: Fixed a few compiler warnings.

2007-07-27 10:25  abbotti

	* comedi/Makefile.am: Turned off verbose kernel make output to make
	  it easier to spot compiler warnings.

2007-07-27 10:05  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: INSN_CONFIG_GET_CLOCK_SRC now
	  returns the period in data[2] for internal clock sources.  (For
	  external and chained clock sources it is set to 0.)

2007-07-26 16:36  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/comedi_ksyms.c,

	  comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c, comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c,
	  comedi/drivers/ni_tio.h, include/linux/comedidev.h: Protected use
	  of subdevice runflags with spinlock, since it is modified in
	  comedi_event().  Replaced most usage of SDF_RUNNING in
	  subdev_flags with SRF_RUNNING in runflags so I don't have to
	  protect subdev_flags with a lock too.  Made
	  mite_release_channel() always disarm and reset mite channel.
	  Move ack/confirm of counter interrupts/errors into ni_tio.  Added
	  ni_tio_set_mite_channel(), which acquires counter's spinlock
	  before modifiying its mite channel.  Added some missing locking
	  of mite_channel_lock in ni_mio_common.c.

2007-07-24 15:45  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h, ni_mio_common.c, ni_pcidio.c:
	  Added mite_done() query to ask if mite channel is currently
	  running, handle CHSR_DONE in mite.c now (in mite_get_status() in
	  particular).

2007-07-24 13:47  abbotti

	* Makefile.am, comedi/comedi_fops.c,
	  include/linux/devfs_fs_kernel.h: Removed
	  include/linux/devfs_fs_kernel.h We don't need it now and it
	  causes build to fail for kernel 2.6.23-rc1.

2007-07-24 12:15  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h, ni_mio_common.c, ni_tio.c: DMA
	  works for input with buffered counting on e-series now.

2007-07-24 07:57  abbotti

	* comedi/Makefile.am: Clean Module.symvers in addition to
	  Modules.symvers.  (I think the one created depends on the kernel
	  version, so delete both!).

2007-07-24 07:48  abbotti

2007-07-21 22:30  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/rti800.c: Added little sanity check for buffer
	  overrun of gaindelay array.

2007-07-21 22:23  fmhess

	  comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c, comedi/drivers/ni_stc.h,
	  comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c, include/linux/comedi.h: Buffered
	  counting with dma works now for m-series boards.  Made attempt to

	  silently.  Added support for digital input filters on pfi ports
	  for m-series.  Fixed some random bugs.

2007-07-12 10:55  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedi.h: Added enum of digital PFI filters on

2007-07-10 09:18  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c: Preserve state of Gi_DMA_Config register
	  bits.

2007-07-10 09:01  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_tio.c, ni_tio.h:
	  Put ni_gpct_device pointer in ni_gpct struct, so it doesn't have
	  to be passed around everywhere as a separate parameter.

2007-07-09 16:12  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h, ni_tio.c,
	  ni_tio.h: Realized that "struct ni_gpct" needs to have a
	  "ni_gpct_device" struct split out of it, which is shared by all
	  counters on a board.

	  Need to hold mite_channel_lock in ni_mio_common when calling
	  ni_tio functions that use mite channel.

2007-07-06 15:12  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Replaced magic numbers for
	  subdevice indices with an enum.  Also, inching towards gpct
	  command support.

2007-07-06 13:08  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: Added some ack'ing of
	  b interrupts, and do acks before handling interrupts, to avoid a
	  race (which seems possible in theory).

2007-07-05 20:05  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: Kbuild, Makefile.am, serial2002.c: Patch from

	  counting with NI M-series boards.

2007-06-27 11:31  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc236.c, plx9052.h: Simplified plx9052.h
	  and moved PCI236-specific bits into amplc_pc236.c.

2007-06-27 10:37  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Allow board-specific names to be
	  used to configure the device.  For backwards compatibility, the
	  driver name can still be used as a wildcard to configure any
	  supported device.

	  I'll use this in future plans to support newer versions of the
	  boards, where a board-specific name has to be used to get at the
	  newer features.

2007-06-27 08:30  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Support PCI bus/slot configuration
	  options.

2007-06-27 08:24  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Don't bother reporting any
	  unsupported Amplicon cards that are found.

2007-06-27 08:09  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/contec_pci_dio.c: Added PCI bus/slot configuration
	  options.  Ignored if unset or zero.

2007-06-27 08:00  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/contec_pci_dio.c: Changed comedi driver_name to
	  "contec_pci_dio".  "dummy" was a silly name.

2007-06-27 06:54  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/icp_multi.h: Replace pci_find_device with

2007-06-22 16:08  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: A little more code
	  intended to support counter commands eventually.

2007-06-18 09:53  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/mite.c: Fixed disabling of interrupts in
	  mite_setup().

2007-06-15 11:29  fmhess

2007-05-24 08:41  abbotti

	* comedi/drivers/pcmmio.c: Applied patch from Calin A. Culianu for
	  bug #254.  The MUX for the AI subdevice was being programmed
	  incorrectly for synchronous acquisition of more than one AI
	  channel.

2007-05-08 10:28  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Added check against maximum ao
	  update rate in analog output command test.

2007-05-02 12:45  fmhess

2007-05-02 12:12  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_atmio.c, ni_mio_cs.c, ni_pcimio.c, ni_stc.h:
	  Added ao_speed board field for maximum analog output update rate
	  with commands.

2007-05-02 09:30  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers.c: Tweaked order deallocations happen for an async
	  buffer allocated with vmalloc.

2007-05-01 17:16  fmhess

	* comedi/: comedi_fops.c, drivers.c, drivers/mite.c: Fixed horrible
	  grinding noises on mmap.

2007-05-01 16:16  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, include/linux/comedidev.h: Be more careful
	  about using all the write-allocated buffer space available, in
	  the cases where it was allocated previously but never used.

2007-05-01 16:15  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers.c: Don't set EOMEDI_CB_EOBUF event flag in
	  comedi_buf_write_free(), since it may be called by user writing
	  into buffer.

2007-05-01 16:12  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/mite.c: Handle stop_src TRIG_COUNT with more than
	  one channel correctly when doing output dma.

2007-04-30 14:36  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.h, ni_mio_common.c: Mite channels 4 and 5
	  verified to work with m-series 6289 boards now.

2007-04-29 17:41  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/drivers.c, comedi/drivers/mite.c,
	  comedi/drivers/mite.h, comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c,
	  comedi/drivers/ni_pcidio.c, comedi/drivers/ni_pcimio.c,
	  comedi/drivers/ni_stc.h, include/linux/comedidev.h: Allocate
	  async buffer pages with dma_alloc_coherent, and map them into
	  continguous virtual addresses with vmap.

2007-04-26 15:59  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h, ni_mio_common.c, ni_pcidio.c:
	  Made it possible to request a mite channel from a specific range,
	  instead of just starting at a specified offset.  Only allow use
	  of mite channels 0-3 for ai/ao, since those are the only ones
	  that seem to work.  Commented out 3 ai convert pulses sent when
	  clearing ai fifo on 625x boards (based on NI example code), since
	  it appears to be wrong when tested with real hardware.

2007-04-26 15:29  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_660x.c: Added some documentation of 32 bit dio
	  port.

2007-04-26 13:43  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h, ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c,
	  ni_pcidio.c, ni_pcimio.c, ni_stc.h, ni_tio.c, ni_tio.h: Changed
	  request/release of mite channels to use mite_channel struct
	  pointers, instead of channel indices.  Changed many mite
	  functions to take mite_channel argument instead of a mite_struct
	  and a channel index.	Added mite_dma_descriptor_ring, since
	  drivers need to maintain the descriptors seperatly from a
	  channel, since the channel is reserved/released with each use but
	  the descriptor ring only changes when comedi's buffer is resized.
	  Made ni_mio_common.c dynamically allocate mite channels for
	  ai/ao when needed, instead of permanently assigning mite channels
	  to subdevices.

2007-04-26 11:05  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_labpc_cs.c: Got rid of useless include of
	  mite.h.

2007-04-26 10:58  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers.c: Got rid of call to subdevice's buf_change
	  callback which occurred after device was detached.  Small cleanup
	  of duplicated code.

2007-04-26 10:54  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c,
	  include/linux/comedidev.h: Added support for a cmd_cleanup()
	  callback on subdevices, which is called when a command is
	  finished.  Will be used to release mite DMA channels when no
	  longer in use.

2007-04-19 15:53  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h: Added spinlock to mite_struct
	  for mite_alloc_channel() and mite_free_channel().

	  comedi/kcomedilib/get.c, comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c,
	  include/linux/comedidev.h: Made some changes to async buffer, to
	  better accommodate output dma (added read allocation).  Tweaked
	  memory barrier usage for async buffer to try and improve its
	  correctness.	comedi_buf_munge() is now handled entirely inside
	  comedi_buf_write_free().  Added some helper functions
	  mite_sync_input_dma() and mite_sync_output_dma() for use in
	  driver interrupt handlers.  Added beginnings of support for NI
	  general purpose counter input commands.

2007-04-19 14:59  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_65xx.c: Silenced gcc 4.1.2 compile warning.

2007-04-19 13:18  fmhess

	* configure.ac: Fixed for warning produced by automake 1.10

2007-04-19 11:15  fmhess

	* comedi/Makefile.am: ignore errors from kernel's make modules in
	  all-local, to avoid failure of make install on nfs filesystem
	  with root_squash

2007-03-18 10:46  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/adv_pci_dio.c: Fix from Navneet Kataria
	  <nkataria@npcil.co.in> for the following problem:

	  ... when I initialize the device using comedi_config command, the
	  device's 1st and 9th relay automatically goes to energize state.

2007-02-26 12:23  fmhess

	* Documentation/comedi/insn_config, comedi/comedi_fops.c,
	  comedi/drivers/ni_65xx.c, comedi/drivers/ni_660x.c,
	  include/linux/comedi.h: Added support for configuring dio
	  direction on NI 660x boards through subdevice 1.  Also added
	  support for selecting digital input filter with
	  INSN_CONFIG_ALT_FILTER.

2007-02-20 22:23  fmhess

	* Contributors, comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Bug fix from Edwin
	  Steiner <edwin.steiner@gmx.net>:

	  The problem is that in ni_m_series_load_channelgain_list
	  config_bits is not reset to 0 in the loop over the channels.

2007-02-04 23:04  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Only check if parse_insn returns a negative
	  value.

2007-01-31 20:28  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_660x.c: Counters should start at subdevice 2,
	  not 1 (was blowing away the dio subdevice).

2007-01-30 22:13  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: Makefile.am, pcmmio.c: New driver from "Calin A.
	  Culianu" <calin@ajvar.org>:

	  This driver adds support for the Winsystems PCM-MIO PC/104 based
	  multifunction board.	This board has 16 AI, 8 AO, and 48 DIO
	  channels.  The driver is almost complete -- it is just missing
	  asynchronous mode for AI and AO.  But synchronous mode works
	  fine.  There is even IRQ support for the DIO lines
	  (edge-triggered interrupts).

2007-01-23 21:00  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: pcmda12.c, pcmuio.c: Patch from "Calin A.
	  Culianu" <calin@ajvar.org>:

	  A pet peeve of mine is that the two driver that I wrote, the
	  pcmda12 and pcmuio driver, format incorrectly when displayed on
	  the comedi.org "Supported Hardware" web page.  This is because
	  they are incorrectly formatted in the driver's "Devices:" line.
	  This patch fixes this so that the Devices: line is now correctly
	  formatted.

2007-01-12 14:55  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_660x.c, ni_mio_common.c: Ported ni_660x.c to

2007-01-08 16:42  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c: Fixed some breaks that were supposed to
	  break out of switches.  Fixed setting of first gate source when
	  choosing NI_GPCT_GATE_PIN_GATE_SELECT().

2007-01-08 16:10  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedi.h: Fixed NI_GPCT_CLOCK_SRC_SELECT_MASK to
	  allow for PFI sources.

2007-01-08 15:49  fmhess

	  set by the driver.

2007-01-05 15:54  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Fixed reading of counters'
	  hardware and software save registers.

2007-01-05 15:38  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_atmio.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_mio_cs.c,
	  ni_pcimio.c, ni_stc.h: Ported ni_mio_common.c to use ni_tio.c for
	  NI general-purpose counter support.  Have tested only counter in
	  continuous pulse generation mode so far (see
	  comedilib/demo/gpct_pulse_generator.c which I will soon commit to
	  comedilib cvs).

2007-01-05 15:35  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedi.h: Changed value of
	  NI_GPCT_DISABLED_GATE_SELECT so it plays nice with CR_CHAN macro,
	  which I used in ni_tio.c

2007-01-05 10:25  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c,
	  include/linux/comedi.h: Renamed INSN_CONFIG_RESET_COUNT to more
	  general INSN_CONFIG_RESET.  Made setting of count on ni
	  general-purpose counters leave the values of the load a/b
	  registers, and the load source select undisturbed.

2007-01-05 09:19  fmhess

	* Documentation/comedi/insn_config, comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c,
	  include/linux/comedi.h: Added mode bit for selecting load a/b
	  counter load sources on NI general- purpose counters.  Renamed a
	  couple members of the ni_gpct_arm_source enum.  Added a few lines
	  of documentation about some additional INSN_CONFIG.

2006-12-29 11:47  fmhess

	* comedi/Makefile.am: use $(MAKE) instead of make.  This fixes the
	  use of the -jN option for parallel compilation.

2006-12-20 15:51  fmhess

2006-12-15 15:54  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_tio.c, include/linux/comedi.h: Added support

	  consistent support for NI general-purpose counters.  Will replace
	  counter support in ni_mio_common.c and ni_660x.c.  Note quite
	  done yet, but it compiles.

2006-12-08 11:50  fmhess

	* Documentation/comedi/insn_config, comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c:
	  Added additional field to INSN_CONFIG_SET/GET_GATE_SRC, to
	  support devices with multiple gate inputs (NI counters can have 2
	  gates).

2006-12-06 18:57  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: The flag SDF_CMD_READ was missing
	  which gave the error number "-1" during async reads.

2006-12-06 08:58  fmhess

	* include/linux/config.h: Added missing include of linux/version.h

2006-12-05 16:51  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/: adl_pci9111.c, pcl711.c: Removed the boolean
	  definition from the driver and moved it to stddef.h

2006-12-05 16:50  bporr

	* include/linux/stddef.h: Moved the boolean definition from the
	  driver files to stddef because from 2.6.19 boolean is defined
	  there aleady.

2006-12-05 16:46  bporr

	* include/linux/config.h: From 2.6.19 config.h is no longer needed.
	  Added an ifdef statement.

2006-12-04 18:24  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: Added external trigger support to
	  the driver.  Added a define for 2.6.19 because the completion
	  function is without register arguments (as was pre 2.6.0).
	  Changed the GPIF programming so that it does no longer loops
	  through the idle state. Instead I use the first states to reset
	  the counter for channels.

2006-12-04 18:20  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: From 2.6.19 the pointer to the
	  completion function is (again) without the register argument.
	  That's basically pre 2.6.0

2006-11-29 10:31  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_pcimio.c: Minor update to documentation
	  comments.

2006-11-20 15:15  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h: Mite byte-swapping bits seem to
	  be associated with device/memory ports as opposed to being always
	  16 or 32 bit swaps.

2006-11-20 14:41  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers.c: Fixed possibile failures to decrement module
	  use count on errors (one was bug I probably introduced recently).

2006-11-20 11:37  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_pcimio.c, ni_stc.h:
	  Differentiate between 622x, 625x, and 628x m-series boards.  Fix
	  adc reset for 625x boards, based on example code from ni
	  (untested on hardware).  Fix polarity of AI_CONVERT output for
	  622x boards, based on ni example code.  Do 32 bit pci transfers
	  on analog output dma, now that the sample ordering has been
	  resolved through byte-swapping bits in mite chip.  Use external
	  clock (when configured) for timebase 3 too (I believe timebase 3
	  is the 80 MHz clock).

2006-11-17 11:07  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: mite.c, mite.h: Figured out what a couple bits
	  in the mite channel control register do (byte swapping).  Used
	  them to make 32 bit pci transfers to 16 bit analog outputs
	  practical.

2006-11-17 09:03  fmhess

	* comedi/: comedi_fops.c, drivers.c: Don't assume class_device has
	  a devt member.

2006-11-15 21:10  fmhess

	  Subdevices need to indicate which directions they support
	  commands in with the new subdevice flags SDF_CMD_READ and
	  SDF_CMD_WRITE.  Breaks compatibility with 2.4 kernels.
	  Currently, only 8-bit minor numbers are used, limiting the

	  in syncronization to external clock sources.

2006-10-21 18:54  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: Fixed two small bugs Ian Abbott
	  pointed out. Ian Wrote: The first one is just a tiny mistake in
	  usbduxfast_ai_cmdtest():

		  /* step 3: make sure arguments are trivially compatible
	  */

		  if(cmd->start_arg == TRIG_NOW && cmd->start_arg != 0)

	  should be:

		  if(cmd->start_src == TRIG_NOW && cmd->start_arg != 0)

	  The other one is a mismatch between cmdtest and cmd.	cmdtest
	  checks start_src==TRIG_NOW or start_src==TRIG_EXT, but cmd checks
	  start_src==TRIG_NOW and otherwise assumes start_src==TRIG_INT.

	* comedi/drivers/: Kbuild, Makefile.am, adl_pci7296.c, ni_65xx.c:
	  New drivers from Jonathan Grierson <jd@renko.co.uk>:

	  Hi, I've recently been working with two digital daq cards and
	  have written drivers to get them working with Comedi.

	  The first is for the National Instruments PCI-6514. It could
	  perhaps be merged with the 6527 driver because I used this as a
	  base but the 6514 is part of a series from NI which are all quite
	  similar and not quite as advanced. Let me know what you think.
	  I'm afraid it needed to be done quite quickly and so felt it
	  would be easier to produce a simpler driver rather than hack the
	  existing one.

	  The second is for the Adlink PCI-7296. Just a pci wrapper for 4
	  8255 devices. Only basic IO enabled so far so no interrupts.

2006-10-13 13:44  fmhess

	* include/linux/time.h: Fix for SuSE 9.0 2.4.21 kernel.  Simplify
	  jiffies_to_msecs() and msecs_to_jiffies() to avoid preprocessor
	  optimisations that depend on HZ being a C constant expression.
	  Just round the result up to the nearest integer.  The supported
	  range of input values (avoiding arithmetic overflow) is now less
	  than that of the Linux versions of these functions for common
	  values of HZ, but that's unlikely to cause any problems (and if
	  it does we can fix it by making the functions more complicated).

	  We have written basic drivers for two PC-104 boards we are using
	  at work and we would like to contribute them to the Comedi
	  project.  The drivers are for two Advanced Digital Logic
	  (www.adlogic-pc104.com) boards:

	  104-AIO12-8
	  http://www.adlogic-pc104.com/products/peripherals/datasheets/104-AIO12-8.pdf

	  104-IIRO-16
	  http://www.adlogic-pc104.com/products/peripherals/datasheets/104-IIRO-16.pdf

	  The actual manufacturer is Acces I/O (http://accesio.com).  I
	  believe the same boards are also available from
	  (http://kontron.com)

	  The drivers are basic.  For instance no asynchronous operations
	  are supported.  The drivers do work (tested on Fedora Core 4 and
	  5).

	  subdevice (David MacMahon <davidm@astro.berkeley.edu>)

2006-07-10 11:39  abbotti

	* m4/as-linux.m4: Extend automatic enabling of Kbuild mechanism
	  back as far as kernel 2.6.10 (which is the first Kbuild enabled
	  kernel supported by Comedi) and also enable Kbuild mechanism if
	  separate kernel source and build directories are in use.

	  It ought to be possible to use the Kbuild mechanism back as far
	  as kernel 2.6.8 by checking for the script/mkmakefile file
	  (that's what I tried first, actually), but use of the Kbuild
	  mechanism for 2.6.8 and 2.6.9 is currently incompatible with
	  Comedi's build mechanism (I tried it).

2006-07-10 06:06  abbotti

	* configure.ac, m4/as-modtool.m4: Replaced AC_PATH_PROG with

	  correct 'strip' is used when cross-compiling.

2006-07-06 12:06  abbotti

	* m4/as-linux.m4: Avoid using AC_RUN_IFELSE to check the kernel
	  major.minor version, as it doesn't work when cross-compiling.

	  Every kernel Makefile I've looked at (at least for 2.4 and 2.6,
	  including those for separate kernel build directories) includes
	  the "VERSION = x" and "PATCHLEVEL = y" lines, so use 'sed' to
	  extract the information from those lines.

2006-07-05 07:30  abbotti

	* m4/rtai.m4: Applied patch from Ben Gardiner (blg at mast dot
	  queensu dot ca):

	  It appears as though the changes were applied only to
	  configure.ac.

	  In the current state, setting --disable-rtai will not avoid the
	  check for the presence of an rtai directory (line 16 in
	  m4/rtai.m4) if the user has an adeos/ipipe enabled kernel.

	  In the situation where the users has an adeos/ipipe enabled
	  kernel, and a non-standard rtai directory and does not wish to
	  build comedi with rtai support supplying --disable-rtai is not
	  sufficient to complete the configuration script without error. An
	  additional --with-rtaidir=/non/standard/dir/ must be specified.
	  This seems counter-intuitive since the user has already supplied

	* comedi/drivers/pcm3724.c: Patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian
	  Abbott):

	  The pcm3724 driver is still using the deprecated check_region()
	  call.  Also, it doesn't check if things were allocated properly
	  when cleaning up in the detach routine.

	  The attached patch fixes it.

	* comedi/drivers/: cb_pcidas64.c, daqboard2000.c, dt3000.c,
	  gsc_hpdi.c, me_daq.c, mite.c, rtd520.c, s626.c: Patch from
	  abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  The following driver files call ioremap() but do not check if the
	  return value is NULL:

	  cb_pcidas64.c daqboard2000.c dt3000.c gsc_hpdi.c me_daq.c mite.c
	  rtd520.c s626.c

	  The attached patch takes appropriate action if the return value
	  from ioremap() is NULL.  (In some cases, this also required the
	  addition of a flag 'got_regions' to the device private data
	  structure to record whether the PCI regions need to be released.)

	  The patch also removes the antiquated requirement of the address
	  passed to ioremap() needing to be on a page boundary.

	* comedi/drivers/: Kbuild, Makefile.am, adl_pci9118.c,
	  adv_pci1710.c, amcc_s5933.h: patch from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  I have a patch that changes the adl_pci9118 and adv_pci1710
	  drivers.  It mimics their old behaviour of searching for an
	  unused card, rather than using the first card it finds.  I didn't
	  need to change the cb_pcidas driver after all as it wasn't using
	  the amcc_s5933 driver, only some macros from amcc_s5933.h.

	  The patch also removes the amcc_s5933 module from the Makefile.am
	  and Kbuild files and removes the function declarations, etc.,
	  from the amcc_s5933.h file.

	  comedi/drivers/quatech_daqp_cs.c, include/linux/module.h,
	  include/linux/moduleparam.h: Patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian
	  Abbott):

	  The (few) module parameters used by comedi (for debugging and for
	  specifying irq_mask or irq_list for some PCMCIA drivers) haven't
	  worked since kernel 2.6.11. If you try and specify a module
	  parameter when loading a module, the module fails to load due to
	  missing symbols.

	  I have implemented a linux/moduleparam.h compatibility header
	  using code borrowed from the 2.4.25 kernel with some additions,
	  and a patch to use it.

	  The module_param() macro has been implemented for 2.4 kernels.
	  Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement
	  module_param_array() for 2.4 kernels, so I implemented a similar
	  MODULE_PARAM_ARRAY() macro instead.  The third parameter is
	  different, being the length of the array rather than a
	  (optionally null) pointer to a variable set to the number of
	  elements of the array that have been filled in (that information
	  is not available in 2.4 so I thought it best to omit it
	  entirely).  There is one restriction on the "length of array"
	  parameter; it has to be a decimal number (or a macro that expands
	  to a decimal number), not a fancy C expression, otherwise insmod
	  won't parse it properly (if at all!).

2006-06-11 21:02  fmhess

	* configure.ac: Patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  Sometimes USB support breaks due to API changes in 2.6 or vendor
	  patches (e.g.  Fedora Core 5's 2.6.15 kernel), so it would be
	  useful to have a configure option to disable it, like there is
	  for PCMCIA.

	  planning to revert/alter parts of this patch shortly, I am
	  commiting the original patch so it is clear what I changed.

	  I've been through the PCI code of all the drivers (apart from the
	  ones in the addi_data directory) to apply the following rules:

	  1. Call pci_enable_device before looking at resources.  (I didn't
	  do this for the card list display code in amcc_s5933.c as it's
	  only for debugging; it might display bogus values on some
	  platforms.)

	  2. Call pci_request_regions to request all PCI I/O and memory
	  areas.  (Some drivers were calling request_region on a subset of
	  the valid regions, but pci_request_regions is preferred.  Some
	  drivers didn't bother requesting regions and just used them
	  anyway.)

	  3. If 1 and 2 succeeded, then when done with the device (on
	  comedi detach), call pci_release_regions and pci_disable_device.
	  Note that pci_disable_device is not called if rule 2 failed,
	  because that indicates that the device is being used by something
	  else (most likely another comedi device).

	  I've fixed some brokenness along the way, but the amcc_s5933
	  driver will still break if more than one client driver uses it
	  (but at least it now works if more than one device is using that
	  client driver).  To fix it properly will require separate device
	  lists for each vendor ID and maybe a reference count for each of
	  those lists - a job for another day!

	  More brokenness in the adv_pci_dio driver has been fixed. It
	  tried to be clever by keeping a list of PCI devices in use, but
	  its list handling code was completely broken.

	  I changed the s626 driver to use pci_get_device and
	  pci_put_device instead of the old pci_find_device.

	  I've checked over the changes twice, but am not able to test all
	  the drivers of course, so I might have introduced an odd bug or
	  two, but I hope not!

2006-04-18 20:10  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/pcmuio.c: Patch from calin@ajvar.org (Calin A.
	  Culianu):

	  I modified the driver to more correctly reflect the physical
	  connectors on the PCMUIO board.  Basically rather than have
	  32-channel subdevices, I am making the board use 24-channel
	  subdevices.

	  The reason is simple: The board has 25-pin connectors.  Either
	  two of them for the 48-channel version or 4 of them for the
	  96-channel version.  Anyway, I made this driver create 1
	  subdevice per connector.  It turns out in practice it is more
	  useful to have 4 subdevices with 24 channels each than it is to
	  have 3 subdevices with 32 channels -- since you have to do funny
	  math in your head to figure out what channel 7 on subdevice 2 is.
	   By having a 1-to-1 association between subdevice and physical
	  connector, it's much easier to work with.

2006-01-28 10:31  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci230.c: Patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian

	  Micheal Head reported problems with the PCI230 generating
	  interrupts constantly in his system.

	  Looking at the source code, that could happen if the AI interrupt
	  handler (pci230_handle_ai) detects a FIFO overrun error.  In that
	  case, it ends up turning the ADC interrupt source back on in the
	  board's INT_SCE by mistake after cancelling the transfer,
	  resulting in continuous unhandled interrupts.

	  I have a patch to fix the above and initialize the INT_SCE
	  register before hooking up the interrupt with request_irq.

2005-12-28 12:12  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_pcimio.c: Added some missing registers used by
	  ai commands to m_series_stc_writew().

2005-12-21 21:21  fmhess

	  some m-series board entries using board specification documents.

2005-12-18 20:32  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: ao write instructions
	  work on pci-6289 after adding initialization of AO_Calibration
	  register (turns off grounding of ao reference).

2005-12-18 19:42  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: Some fixes for m series ai/ao

2005-12-14 19:01  fmhess

	* m4/rtai.m4: Patch from "Andreas Leuner" <al14@inf.tu-dresden.de>:

	  I have modified the rtai.m4 script locally to recognize a kernel
	  with ipipe support. With this the generated configure script
	  detects ipipe support and activates RTAI support. The so modified
	  comedi compiles fine and modules load without any crashes.
	  However I haven't tested the result with real daq hardware yet.

2005-12-14 08:10  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_pcimio.c: Added preliminary board entries for

	  ni_pcimio.c, ni_stc.h: First pass at m-series support done.
	  AI/AO might possibly work (after adding entries for m-series
	  boards to board array), digital subdevices definitely won't yet.

2005-12-11 16:41  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_mio_common.c, ni_stc.h: Fixed array overrun
	  for boards with more than 2 ao channels.

2005-12-04 22:32  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_stc.h: Added enumeration of all m series
	  register offsets.

2005-12-04 20:05  fmhess

	* include/linux/kref.h: Patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  KREF_PUT can be simplified for 2.6.12 upwards - it just needs to
	  call kref_put and pass on the return value.

	  Also, the kref stuff first appeared in 2.6.5, not 2.6.0.

2005-12-03 22:20  fmhess

	  moved under m-series

	  <dfelson.celson@virgin.net>:

	  Tried the NI 6602 in single pulse, surprised (!) the	case
	  INSN_CONFIG_GPCT_SINGLE_PULSE_GENERATOR:

	   ran into the
	   case INSN_CONFIG_GPCT_PULSE_TRAIN_GENERATOR:

	   without a break.

2005-11-23 17:48  fmhess

	* include/asm/pgtable.h: pud_t was introduced in kernel 2.6.11

2005-11-23 07:59  fmhess

2005-11-20 20:21  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/dt9812.c: Added documentation header to dt9812
	  driver.

2005-11-20 20:16  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: Makefile.am, dt9812.c, dt9812.h: New driver from
	  anders.blomdell@control.lth.se (Anders Blomdell):

	  This driver works, but bulk transfers not implemented. Might be a
	  starting point for someone else. I found out too late that USB
	  has too high latencies (>1 ms) for my needs.

2005-11-20 20:15  fmhess

	* include/linux/kref.h: Added compatibility wrapper for kref.h

2005-11-20 19:24  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/serial2002.c: Patch from
	  anders.blomdell@control.lth.se (Anders Blomdell):

	  make poll point to the right subfield

2005-11-20 19:23  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/daqboard2000.c: Patch from
	  anders.blomdell@control.lth.se (Anders Blomdell):

	  fix warning messages (might be that 8255_cb should change
	  signature)

2005-11-20 19:11  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Static initialization of spinlocks has been
	  deprecated by the kernel (from anders.blomdell@control.lth.se
	  (Anders Blomdell)).

2005-11-20 16:35  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/cb_pcidas64.c: Fix scan counter loading, which
	  needs to be set to desired count minus 3 (fix from Derek Foreman
	  <Derek.Foreman@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca>).  Fixed verified correct on
	  pci-das6036 and 6025.

2005-11-01 19:39  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: daqboard2000.c, multiq3.c, serial2002.c: Patch
	  from anders.blomdell@control.lth.se (Anders Blomdell):

	  daqboard2000: fixed bug where (sometimes) values were left behind
	  in the FIFO multiq3: start encoder counting from middle of range
	  (2^23) serial2002: fix timing issues in 2.6 kernels, add encoder

2005-11-01 19:21  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: cb_das16_cs.c, das08_cs.c, ni_daq_dio24.c,
	  ni_labpc_cs.c, ni_mio_cs.c, quatech_daqp_cs.c: Patch from
	  abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  The following drivers do not compile for 2.6.13 upwards due to
	  the removal of the pcmcia_get_card_services_info function,
	  servinfo_t typedef and CS_RELEASE_CODE macro:

	   cb_das16_cs
	   das08_cs
	   ni_daq_dio24
	   ni_labpc_cs
	   ni_mio_cs
	   quatech_daqp_cs

	  I think the best solution is to remove the offending code
	  altogether along with the #include <pcmcia/version.h> lines as
	  CS_RELEASE_CODE has had the same value since at least 2.4.0 and
	  Comedi doesn't support earlier kernels anymore.

2005-10-18 23:10  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: free async->cmd.chanlist before it gets
	  blown away by user's cmd

2005-10-18 22:38  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Fix memory leak noted by "Michael Brooks"
	  <mbrooks@orbitalnetwork.com>

2005-10-16 17:45  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/8253.h, comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c,
	  include/linux/comedi.h: Patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian
	  Abbott):

	  I have added support for the following additional Amplicon 200
	  series boards to the amplc_dio200 driver: PC212E, PC214E, PC215E,
	  PC218E, PCI215.  These have a mixture of 8255 dio chips and 8254
	  counter chips (except PC218E which has no 8255).

	  As well as changing comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c, the patch adds
	  some extra inline functions to comedi/drivers/8253.h and adds
	  four extra INSN_CONFIG_xxx defines to include/linux/comedi.h (for
	  configuring clock and gate sources for the counter subdevices).

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc263.c, cb_pcidas.c: patch from
	  abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  At the end of February (or possibly the beginning of March,
	  depending on your timezone!) I submitted a patch to remove
	  pci_find_device and use pci_get_device and pci_dev_put (and
	  occasionally pci_dev_get) instead.

	  I messed up on the amplc_pc262 and cb_pcidas drivers as I forgot
	  to replace pci_find_device with pci_get_device, but added the
	  calls to pci_dev_put, so the PCI reference counts would go
	  negative when the device was detached.  The attached patch
	  corrects this problem and also fixes an unrelated gcc warning in
	  the cb_pcidas driver about a possibly ambiguous 'else' requiring
	  braces (my fault again!).

	  This driver is based on the Sensoray 626 GPL Linux driver

	  The ai_poll function is not yet implemented

	  ao_cmd support is under development

	  The 48 dio channels are divided in to 3 subdev (2,3 and 4) with
	  16 channels (each group of 16 channels is managed by a different
	  hardware registers). These can be grouped in one subdev with 48
	  bit mask. Channels 0-39 can be used as TRIG_EXT arg for ai_cmd
	  (cmd->start_src=TRIG_EXT; cmd->start_arg=20; subdev 3 channel 3
	  is used as external trigger)

	  Encoder/timer device has a lot of configuration option. Now only
	  the encoder configuration is avaiable. If ai_cmd
	  scan_begin_src=TRIG_TIMER or convert_src=TRIG_TIMER are selected,
	  the timer channel 5 and 4 respectively are used as trigger.

	  The code is filled with a lot of debugging messages visible
	  compiling the code with -D_DEBUG_ flag

	  include/linux/pci.h: Patch from Ian Abbot <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  I've done some work on getting rid of the check_region calls
	  which are now deprecated.

	  I first mentioned this back in March and did a little bit of work
	  on it at the time:

	  https://cvs.comedi.org/pipermail/comedi/2005-March/006971.html
	  https://cvs.comedi.org/pipermail/comedi/2005-March/006977.html

	  My new patch seems to be too large for the comedi mailing list -
	  they just disappear into a black hole, so here is a description
	  of my latest patch:

	  I used a static inline function called compat__request_region and
	  (re)defined a macro called request_region to use it.	The result
	  is that drivers can check the return value of request_region (or
	  pci_request_regions) instead of calling check_region.  Note that
	  the compat__request_region does not return a pointer to anything
	  real, but it can be compared to NULL.

	  The attached patch implements the above compatibility stuff and
	  changes the drivers to use it (but I changed the amplc_pci230
	  driver to use pci_request_regions instead of request_region while
	  I was at it).  I've also changed the compatibility version of
	  pci_request_regions to avoid calling check_regions (otherwise it
	  would be called twice) and also made it release any regions it
	  successfully requested on failure.

	  Most of the changes to the individual drivers were
	  straightforward.  One or two required a modicum of thought to
	  release resources on error.

	  "Unknown symbol" while loading comedi module (and the following
	  ones because of the symbols in it).  I've changed
	  include/linux/mm.h slightly, hopefully without breaking anything.
	  Seems to work. I've tested it with 2.6.10 and 2.6.11.

	  there were two devices. Thus, the second device never got the
	  firmware uploaded. Thanks to Bjorn Kinell.

2005-03-12 08:31  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_pci224.c: patch from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  Here's a change to my new amplc_pci224 driver to use
	  pci_request_regions instead of check_region/request_region, as
	  suggested by Frank.

2005-03-07 21:35  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: Makefile.am, amplc_pci224.c: new driver from
	  abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott):

	  Here's a new driver for the Amplicon PCI224 and PCI234 analog
	  output cards, supporting streaming AO.  It seems to be working
	  well except that the first scan can misfire at the start of
	  acquisition, and I can't find a way to work around this hardware
	  problem.  It shouldn't matter too much for waveform output.  I've
	  mentioned it in the caveats section of the driver documentation.

	  mite.c, rtd520.c: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  updates the drivers to use pci_get_device() instead of
	  pci_find_device() and fixes a few other bits that seemed to be
	  broken: mostly insufficient checking in the 'detach' routines.

2005-03-03 18:08  fmhess

	* include/linux/pci.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  adds two more compatibility definitions for 'pci_dev_get()' and

2005-03-03 17:06  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/daqboard2000.c: updated documentation: firmware

2005-02-28 18:35  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/cb_pcidas64.c: 6035 only has 12 bit analog output

	  member to board struct to deal with it.

2005-02-28 18:24  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/gsc_hpdi.c: don't use deprecated
	  pci_find_subsys(), replace with pci_get_subsys() (and
	  pci_dev_put())

2005-02-27 19:07  fmhess

	* include/linux/pci.h: implementation of pci_find_subsys for old
	  kernels from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian Abbott), and #defines for
	  pci_get_subsys() and pci_dev_put() from me.

2005-02-27 18:47  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/dt3000.c: patch from abbotti@mev.co.uk (Ian
	  Abbott):

	  "modprobe dt3000" fails on current 2.6 kernels due to missing
	  symbols in the PCI stuff.

	  The attached patch should fix it, but needs testing properly.
	  I've checked that it modprobes okay, but don't have the hardware
	  to make sure it finds the board okay.

2005-02-27 18:42  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/adl_pci9111.c: patch from
	  emmanuel.pacaud@univ-poitiers.fr (Emmanuel Pacaud):

	  here's a patch that extends AI streaming capabilities of the
	  adl_pci9111 driver, and fixes analog output.

2005-02-27 18:31  fmhess

	* include/linux/mm.h: need to change things around a little to
	  prevent asm/tlb.h from breaking compilation against debian 2.4.27
	  kernel headers

2005-02-27 18:12  fmhess

	* include/: linux/device.h, pcmcia/ds.h: patch from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  The last change to das08_cs.c on Feb 5 breaks on 2.4, though the
	  change itself was not unreasonable (it saves a few bytes at
	  least).  The problem is that the change was incompatible with the
	  version of struct device_driver defined in comedi's
	  linux/device.h compatibility header.	In the "real" version of
	  struct device_driver, the "name" member is a "char *", but in the
	  compatibility version it's a "dev_info_t", which is a "char[32]".

	  The attached patch sorts it out in the compatibility headers.

2005-02-27 17:26  fmhess

	* include/: asm/pgtable.h, linux/mm.h: patch from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch against CVS also applies to comedi-0.7.69 and allows
	  it to compile correctly against Red Hat 9's 2.4.20-8 kernel, and
	  probably others using the "statm" kernel patch.  It also changes
	  the conditions for defining the pte_offset_kernel() macro in the
	  asm/pgtable.h compatibility header to avoid it being redefined.

2005-02-27 17:05  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/amplc_dio200.c: patch from Ian Abbot
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  I think it's probably a bad idea for my amplc_dio200 driver to
	  call comedi_event() while it's holding a spinlock.  The call to
	  comedi_event could call a kcomedilib client's callback function,
	  which might do something that requires the same spinlock, leading
	  to a deadlock.

	  The attached patch moves the calls to comedi_event() to a safe
	  point after the spinlock is released.

2005-02-26 21:15  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: Removed a buffer overflow routine
	  again. The buffer overflow can only be detected in the firmware
	  when 3 out of 4 buffers are full.  Thus, the condition that all 4
	  buffers are full gives already an buffer overflow.

2005-02-21 16:02  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/8253.h: replace 0x10000 with max_count constant,
	  and handle a couple more corner cases

2005-02-21 15:52  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/8253.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  Here's a couple more minor patches for the
	  i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div function, which I should have
	  spotted earlier.

	  8253_dupcalc.patch gets rid of a duplicate calculation
	  8253_overflow.patch adds some arithmetic overflow checks to the
	  "early exit" test.

2005-02-17 18:37  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc236.c, comedi_parport.c: patch from	Ian
	  Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch sets the COMEDI_CB_BLOCK event in the interrupt
	  routines of the comedi_parport and amplc_pc236 drivers, as
	  whatever is monitoring the interrupts probably wants to know
	  about them as soon as possible!

2005-02-17 18:23  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: Makefile.am, amplc_dio200.c: new driver from Ian
	  Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>

2005-02-17 18:15  fmhess

	* include/linux/compiler.h: inew compatibility header from Ian
	  Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>

2005-02-17 18:13  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: usbdux.c, usbduxfast.c: add missing include for
	  likely/unlikely

2005-02-17 17:58  fmhess

	* include/asm/semaphore.h: new compatibility header from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  Here's an asm/semaphore.h compatibility header to help build
	  Comedi drivers for kernel versions prior to 2.2.18.  It defines
	  the following missing macros:

	  init_MUTEX(x) init_MUTEX_LOCKED(x) DECLARE_MUTEX(name)
	  DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED(name)

	  I didn't define sema_init(sem, val) as I the implementation is
	  arch-dependent.

2005-02-17 17:48  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/8253.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch improves the "early exit" test in the
	  i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer_2div function (comedi/drivers/8253.h)
	  to take account of a divisor of 65536 being represented by 0.

2005-02-17 17:42  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: patch from Emmanuel PACAUD
	  <emmanuel.pacaud@univ-poitiers.fr>:

	  Here's a trivial patch that closes comedi device file when
	  detaching comedi_rt_timer driver.

2005-02-08 20:53  fmhess

	* include/linux/sched.h: patch from Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch adds compatibility code for the 'wait_event()' macro
	  in linux/sched.h for kernels prior to 2.2.3.	The actual
	  implementation in this patch has been taken from 2.2.14.

2005-02-07 18:36  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c: Added proper insn command with a
	  sampling rate of 1MHz/16.  Now 4 packets are ignored before data
	  is sampled. One packet was not enough.  Improved timing for the
	  multiplexer. Should run now reliable at high rates.

2005-02-06 11:22  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedi.h: fix license header (comedilib is lgpl)

2005-02-06 11:06  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/cb_pcidas.c: force read from channel 0 when
	  CR_ALT_SRC is set in ai read insn.

2005-02-05 10:23  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/das08_cs.c: fix pcmcia_driver.drv.name

2005-02-05 10:22  fmhess

	* include/linux/sched.h: fix for need_resched from Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>:

	  This patch alters the Comedi driver's linux/sched.h compatibility
	  header to move the need_resched function after the #include_next
	  directive.  This is because the 'current' task variable is not
	  defined until after the real linux/sched.h is included.  I've
	  also removed the comment - "/* not sure exactly when
	  need_resched() was added */"; I've checked, and it was added in
	  2.4.20 as the code stated.  I thought I'd fix the incorrect
	  comment at the top of the file while I was at it.

2005-02-03 18:48  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/mite.c: enable burst mode dma transfers on mite

2005-01-25 18:44  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/: amplc_pc236.c, amplc_pc263.c: patch from Ian
	  Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>, who says:

	  This patch fixes a harmless logical error in the _attach routines
	  of the amplc_pc236 and amplc_pc263 drivers that I noticed while
	  looking at the pci_for_each_dev stuff.  Also, now that the
	  drivers ar using pci_find_device instead of pci_for_each_dev, the
	  patch offloads some of the searching for a matching PCI device to
	  the pci_find_device function.

	  The bug is just after the loop that finds the PCI device ID table
	  entry that matches the comedi board name.  The test for reaching
	  the end of the PCI device ID table without finding a match was
	  incorrect.  I say the bug is harmless because there would have to
	  be another bug somewhere else to trigger this bug.

2005-01-25 18:41  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_fc.c: fix rounding error in
	  bytes_per_scan() for dio subdevices, noted by  Ian Abbott
	  <abbotti@mev.co.uk>.	Also, round to nearest sampl_t or  lsampl_t
	  size, instead of nearest byte size.

2005-01-22 21:45  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c, include/linux/comedi.h: rename some members

	* comedi/drivers/8255.c: fix for cmdtest check of start_arg, from
	  Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>

	* comedi/drivers/cb_pcimdda.c: fix for gcc3.4 compile error from
	  Ian Abbott <abbotti@mev.co.uk>

2005-01-13 14:37  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c:

	  Removed a transfer flag which gave a compilation error under
	  2.4.x.  Transfer works without it anyway. Thanks to Ian Abbott
	  who reported the bug.

2005-01-04 14:29  fmhess

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: get rid of KILL_FASYNC define, since it is
	  already in linux/fs.h compat header

2005-01-04 12:10  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c:
	  Tested with 2.6.10. Introduced min sampling rate which is 60kHz.

2005-01-04 12:04  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c:
	  Minor changes. Tested with 2.6.10.

2005-01-04 12:01  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/Makefile.am:
	  Compilation aborted because the makefile wasn't able to generate
	  object files for some drivers. Added some missing lines like:
	  pcl812_ko_SOURCES = pcl812.c

2005-01-03 18:43  fmhess

	* include/linux/comedi_rt.h: fix rtlinux compile

2005-01-03 17:48  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c:
	  From kernel version 2.6.10 the function usb_kill_urb has to be
	  used instead of the old unlink function. This makes hotplugging
	  much safer, in particular when the user unplugs the device while
	  it is transmitting data.  Also added some comments to the debug
	  defines.

2005-01-03 12:22  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c:
	  Switched from iso transfer to bulk transfer. ISO is not the right
	  transfer mode as it imposes a certain sampling rate. The sampling
	  rate, however, is set by the GPIF and not by the transfer
	  protocol.

2004-12-28 22:10  fmhess

2004-12-28 20:13  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: generate overflow events when ai

2004-12-28 20:07  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_at_ao.c: Fixed bugs reported by
	  csp@andrew.cmu.edu.  The bug report was as follows:

	  I have been attempting to get a NI-ATAO10, a 10 channel legacy
	  ISA analog output board, working with comedi. Apparantely the way
	  comedi_from_phys works to convert voltage to sample doesn't seem
	  to work correctly with the ATAO10 board.  I found that the
	  correct sample data for the ATAO10 board is as follows:

	  In unipolar mode 0V = 2048 +10V = 6143

	  In bipolar mode -10V = 2048 +10V = 6143

	  It seems that comedi_from_phys is somehow shifted by 2048 from
	  what it should be (comedi_from_phys gives values from 0 to 4095).

	  Furthermore, comedi does not detect the polarity of the board
	  (I'm not sure if this is possible on this board); thus the range
	  is always reported as -10V to +10V even if the board is set on
	  unipolar mode (which is achieved by setting jumpers on the
	  board).

	  Finally, for some reason, channel 0 does not work with Comedi
	  (the board fully works in Windows). The other 9 channels work.

	  generated correctly

2004-11-14 18:12  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbduxfast.c:
	  cmd is now dumping the first 5 packets. They are usually
	  leftovers from last the cmd: 4 packets from the quad buffer in
	  the usbduxfast and one packet kept by the host controller.

2004-11-10 19:20  bporr

	* include/linux/usb.h:
	  The memory allocation flag GFP_KERNEL is not permissible in an
	  interrupt callback. It has to be GFP_ATOMIC. The submit_urb
	  function has been called with the wrong kernel kernel flag. It's
	  now GFP_ATOMIC. Thanks for the feedback from Dave Brownell.

2004-11-09 18:20  bporr

2004-09-05 15:12  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: Typo in the synchonous out command: in
	  case of an error the synchronous _in_ command was stopped instead

	  connections.

2004-08-31 21:50  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/ni_mio_common.c: return error if a command is run
	  with no irq

2004-08-18 18:36  bporr

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: The submission of the bulk transfers can
	  be delayed. This leads in the worst case to a change in the order
	  of bulk transfers. For example, the insn command requests the
	  counter value. After that another insn requests the status of the
	  digital port. It happens that these requests are swapped in their
	  temporal order because the USB controller might delay a
	  submission because of heavy traffic. The linux kernel _assumes_
	  that the packet has been sent. In fact this can't be guaranteed.
	  Therefore now the packet which is sent from the firmware is
	  checked. If it is the wrong one it is requested again.

	* comedi/drivers/usbdux.c: usbdux driver update from Bernd Porr:

	  This patch resolves problems with buggy VIA/SIS USB controllers.
	  They tend to loose IRQs in high speed mode. In the 2.6.4 kernel
	  there's now a watchdog timer which triggers an interrupt after
	  5ms. To make this safely work with the usbdux driver the number
	  of buffers has been increased to 10 for the high speed mode and
	  to 5 for the full speed mode.  There are also some minor changes:
	  removed unnecessary defines and removed the text that firmware
	  upload through comedi is deprecated. In fact some distros have
	  fxload not installed so that comedi itself has (still) to do the
	  job.

	  who says:

	  Had to change the USB 2.0 transfer protocol from IRQ transfer to
	  ISO transfer.  Reason: IRQ transfer is still not stable
	  (2.4/2.6). However, ISO transfer has been rewritten in the kernel
	  and works (just now in 2.6 but will be backported sooner or
	  later)! I supply new firmware and a new version of the driver
	  which now uses ISO transfer throughout (1.1 / 2.0).

	* INSTALL: added a paragraph about preparing a kernel source
	  directory to match an already compiled kernel.

2002-02-06 16:48  ds

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Revert poll conditions: if device is
	  non-busy, set the poll flags so the app can read the error.  This
	  is how it used to be, and I'm not sure why I changed (broke) it.

	* comedi/drivers/: ni_atmio.c, ni_mio_common.c, ni_mio_cs.c,

	* comedi/comedi_fops.c: Revert some previous dumb changes with
	  events.  This should get polling/select/regular read working
	  again.  There is an unresolved problem:  a normal select/read
	  cycle on a device will fail to show the end of acquisition.  One
	  solution is to always have the app read 0 bytes at the end of
	  acquisition, but people got confused when that was necessary.

	  beginning of interrupt handler from end.

2001-12-14 14:25  ds

	* Makefile.modbuild, scripts/dep.rtai, scripts/dep.rtlinux: Fix
	  Makefile.modbuild to delete Makefiles on distclean, CFLAGS not to
	  duplicate kernel flags. Fix scripts/dep.* to not add to CFLAGS if
	  the RTAI/RTLinux include directories don't exist.  (Might not be
	  an error -- otherwise it's difficult to compile for a real-time
	  patched kernel without the RTAI/RTLinux source.)

	  configures MITE for correct # of bytes. mite interrupt handler
	  now stops blocking when the MITE transfers a chunk of data.
	  handle_a_interrupt() does not stop the MITE prematurely (when STC
	  generates a SC.TC. interrupt)

2001-05-10 11:30  fmhess

	* comedi/drivers/comedi_rt_timer.c: fixed a bug I created, noticed
	  that commands only work right the first try.	Second try command

	  comedi_rt.h so that spin locks can be used through including
	  comedi_rt.h instead of having to go through comedidev.h.  This
	  include was originally removed due to circular dependence between
